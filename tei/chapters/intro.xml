    St. Paul taught that faith came by means of hearing, and one of the distinctive effects of the sixteenth-century reformations of Western Christianity was that Christians discovered new ways to make their faith audible.
    Voices raised in acrid contention or pious devotion boomed from pulpits, clamored in public squares, and were echoed in homes and schools.
    In new forms of vernacular music, the voices of the newly distinct communities united to articulate their own vision of Christian faith.
    Catholic reformers and missionaries enlisted music in their campaigns to educate, evangelize, and build Christian civilization, both in an increasingly divided Europe and in the new domains of the Spanish crown across the globe. 
    In these efforts to make <q>the word of Christ</q> to be heard and believed, then, what was the role of music?
    What kind of power did Catholics believe music had over the dynamics of hearing and faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    This book is a study of how Christians in early modern Spain and Spanish America enacted religious beliefs about music through the medium of music itself.
    It focuses on villancicos, a widespread genre of devotional poetry and musical performance, for two primary reasons.
    First, these pieces were actively employed by the Spanish church and state as tools for propagating faith.
    By the seventeenth century villancicos had grown in to a complex, large-scale form of vocal and instrumental music based on poetic texts in the vernacular, and they were performed in and around liturgical celebrations on all the major feast days, across the Spanish world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In their poetic themes and in their musical content, villancicos combined elements of elite and common culture. 
    In subject matter as well as in the places and occasions of their performance, villancicos stood on the threshold between the world in and outside of church (which is not quite the same as a modern divide between sacred and secular). 
    The chorus of Puebla Cathedral in colonial Mexico, singing a villancico by chapelmaster Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla on Christmas Eve 1653, expressed the boundary-crossing nature of villancicos through a food metaphor (poem <ptr target="#poem:A_la_jacara_jacarilla"/>).
    Sets of villancicos featured dramatic, often comic texts reminiscent of Spanish minor theater (<term>teatro menor</term>) alongside cultivated and even arcanely sophisticated theological reflections.
    The music for villancicos covered a wide stylistic range from old-style polyphonic techniques to highly rhythmic music drawing on dance traditions, as in <title>A la jácara, jacarilla</title> (music example <ptr target="#music:Padilla-A_la_jacara_jacarilla"/>).

    Villancicos are valuable, then, for assessing the interaction of these distinctive elements that meet within the genre.
    Were villancicos a form of top-down <soCalled>propaganda</soCalled> intended to indoctrinate and control, as some have claimed of post-Tridentine religious arts?
    Or were they a grassroots expression of popular devotion? 
    Did they work on multiple levels, even contradictory ones?
  </p>
  <p>
    The second reason for focusing on villancicos is that a large portion of the repertoire explicitly addresses theological beliefs about music.
    The Spanish poetry of seventeenth-century villancicos frequently treats musical topics, sometimes using ingenious conceits that create rich and nuances links between musical and theological ideas.
    The musical settings turn a poetic discourse about music into a musical discourse about music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of all the musical forms of Catholic Spain, then, sacred villancicos address the theological nature and function of music most frequently and directly.
    Among the hundreds of surviving musical manuscripts and the vastly large quantity of printed poetry leaflets, a great many pieces begin with direct invocations of the sense of hearing, exhorting hearers to
    <foreign xml:lang="es">oíd</foreign> <gloss>hear</gloss>,
    <foreign xml:lang="es">escuchad</foreign> <gloss>listen</gloss>, and
    <foreign xml:lang="es">atended</foreign> <gloss>pay attention</gloss>.
    Villancico poets and composers favored themes of singing and dancing, as in Christmas sets, for example, they represented the angelic choirs of Christmas, singing and dancing shepherds, Magi, and even animals in the Nativity stable.
    There are also representations of instrumental performance and characteristic dances of different ethnic groups (such as African slaves and <soCalled>gypsies</soCalled>).
    Early example of villancicos about singing include <title>Gil pues a cantar</title> from Pedro Ruimonte's <title>Parnoso español</title> (Antwerp, 1614) and <title>Sobre bro canto llano</title> by Gaspar Fernández (Puebla, 1610).

    A few <soCalled>black</soCalled> villancicos or <term>negrillas</term>, which represent dark-skinned people dancing and playing instruments in what is supposed to be their characteristic style, have become well known, such as <title>A siolo Flasiquiyo</title> by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (Puebla, 1653) and <title>Los coflades de la estleya</title> by Juan de Araujo (Sucre, ca. 1700).

    These pieces constitute <soCalled>music about music</soCalled>.

    Understanding the theology of music articulated in villancicos can illuminate why and how villancicos were used to propagate faith.
    Doing so will deepen our knowledge of how music general fit into the religious worldview of early modern Catholics.
    For Catholic believers in the Spanish Empire of the seventeenth century, what kind of power did music have to effect the relationship between faith and the sense of hearing?
    If music had supernatural power, how was that power linked to the worldly powers of church and state?
    By engaging interpretively with these villancicos we may gain a better understanding of how early modern Catholics used music for spiritual ends, and how the spiritual intersected with the wordly functions of this music within Spanish society.
  </p>

    This book is the first large-scale attempt to understand the theological aspect of seventeenth-century villancicos across the Hispanic world.
    It is also one of only a few studies to analyze villancicos musically in detail.
    Most importantly, the primary goal of the project is to combine these two modes of analysis, to understand how theological beliefs were expressed and shaped through the details of musical composition and performance.
    The goal is to understand the <term>musical theology</term> of villancicos.
    This term does not mean just a verbal formulation of theological ideas about music by historical figures, and it certainly does not connote a normative theological interpretation from my own personal perspective.
    <note>
      While it may be best to disclose here that I do identify as a Christian, I am not a Roman Catholic and am certainly not a seventeenth-century Spanish Catholic.
      In this study I make no truth claims for or against the historical beliefs I describe.

    </note>
    Instead, we may conceive of this historical form of devotional performance as a communal act in which religious ideas and values were performed <gloss>put into practice</gloss> through musical structures.
    To understand the theological content, we must understand the musical practices; and to make sense of the music, we must seek to hear it as a form of theological expression.
