    Villancicos as Musical Theology

      </p>
      <p>
	Thus faith [comes] from hearing; and hearing, by the word of Christ.
      </p>
      <bibl>
	St. Paul, Romans 10:17
      </bibl>

  <p>
    St. Paul taught that faith came by means of hearing, and one of the distinctive effects of the sixteenth-century reformations of Western Christianity was that Christians discovered new ways to make their faith audible.
    Voices raised in acrid contention or pious devotion boomed from pulpits, clamored in public squares, and were echoed in homes and schools.
    In new forms of vernacular music, the voices of the newly distinct communities united to articulate their own vision of Christian faith.
    Catholic reformers and missionaries enlisted music in their campaigns to educate, evangelize, and build Christian civilization, both in an increasingly divided Europe and in the new domains of the Spanish crown across the globe. 
    In these efforts to make <q>the word of Christ</q> to be heard and believed, then, what was the role of music?
    What kind of power did Catholics believe music had over the dynamics of hearing and faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    This book is a study of how Christians in early modern Spain and Spanish America enacted religious beliefs about music through the medium of music itself.
    It focuses on villancicos, a widespread genre of devotional poetry and musical performance, for two primary reasons.
    First, these pieces were actively employed by the Spanish church and state as tools for propagating faith.
    By the seventeenth century villancicos had grown in to a complex, large-scale form of vocal and instrumental music based on poetic texts in the vernacular, and they were performed in and around liturgical celebrations on all the major feast days, across the Spanish world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In their poetic themes and in their musical content, villancicos combined elements of elite and common culture. 
    In subject matter as well as in the places and occasions of their performance, villancicos stood on the threshold between the world in and outside of church (which is not quite the same as a modern divide between sacred and secular). 
    Sets of villancicos featured dramatic, often comic texts reminiscent of Spanish minor theater (<term>teatro menor</term>) alongside cultivated and even arcanely sophisticated theological reflections.
    The music for villancicos covered a wide stylistic range from old-style polyphonic techniques to highly rhythmic music drawing on dance traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The boundary-crossing nature of villancicos is expressed vividly in one of the more commonly performed villancicos from colonial Mexico, a piece set by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for Puebla Cathedral in 1653, in which the singers describe their own music-making as serving up <q>village feed</q> to a refined courtly table:
    <q rend="block" type="poemtranslation">
      <seg xml:lang="es" xml:id="orig:jacarilla" corresp="#trans:jacarilla">
	<lg>
	  <l>A la jácara, jacarilla,</l>
	  <l>de buen garbo y lindo porte</l>
	  <l>traigo por plato de corte</l>
	  <l>siendo pasto de la villa.</l>
	</lg>
      </seg>
      <seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="trans:jacarilla" corresp="#orig:jacarilla">
	<lg>
	  <l>For the <term>jácara</term>, a little <term>jácara</term>,</l>
	  <l>in good taste and with fair mien</l>
	  <l>I bring as a dish of the court</l>
	  <l>what is really feed from the village.</l>
	</lg>
      </seg>
    </q>
    <note place="end">
      See chapter 7 for further discussion of this piece.
    </note>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Villancicos are valuable, then, for assessing the interaction of these distinctive elements that meet within the genre.
    Were villancicos a form of top-down <soCalled>propaganda</soCalled> intended to indoctrinate and control, as some have claimed of post-Tridentine religious arts?
    Or were they a grassroots expression of popular devotion? 
    Did they work on multiple levels, even contradictory ones?
  </p>
  <p>
    The second reason for focusing on villancicos is that a large portion of the repertoire explicitly addresses theological beliefs about music.
    The Spanish poetry of seventeenth-century villancicos frequently treats musical topics, sometimes using ingenious conceits that create rich and nuances links between musical and theological ideas.
    The musical settings turn a poetic discourse about music into a musical discourse about music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of all the musical forms of Catholic Spain, then, sacred villancicos address the theological nature and function of music most frequently and directly.
    Among the hundreds of surviving musical manuscripts and the even larger quantity of printed poetry leaflets, a great many pieces begin with direct invocations of the sense of hearing, exhorting hearers to <q>hear</q>, <q>listen</q>, and <q>pay attention</q> (<foreign xml:lang="es">oíd</foreign>,
    <foreign xml:lang="es">escuchad</foreign>,
    <foreign xml:lang="es">atended</foreign>).
    Villancico poets and composers favored themes of singing and dancing, as in Christmas sets, for example, they represented the angelic choirs of Christmas, singing and dancing shepherds, Magi, and even animals in the Nativity stable.
    There are also representations of instrumental performance and characteristic dances of different ethnic groups (such as African slaves and <soCalled>gypsies</soCalled>).
    Early example of villancicos about singing include <title>Gil pues a cantar</title> from Pedro Ruimonte's <title>Parnoso español</title> (Antwerp, 1614) and <title>Sobre bro canto llano</title> by Gaspar Fernández (Puebla, 1610).

      <ptr target="#Fernandes2001"/>.
    </note>
    A few <soCalled>black</soCalled> villancicos or <term>negrillas</term>, which represent dark-skinned people dancing and playing instruments in what is supposed to be their characteristic style, have become well known, such as <title>A siolo Flasiquiyo</title> by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (Puebla, 1653) and <title>Los coflades de la estleya</title> by Juan de Araujo (Sucre, ca. 1700).
    <note place="end">
      See chapter <ptr target="#chapter:Puebla"/> for a discussion of <title>A siolo Flasiquiyo</title> and other <soCalled>ethnic</soCalled> villancicos.
      One of several recordings of the Araujo piece is <ptr target="#Skidmore2003"/>.
    </note>
    These pieces constitute <soCalled>music about music</soCalled>.
    If a play within a play in Spanish Golden Age drama may be termed metatheatrical, then these pieces are <soCalled>metamusical</soCalled>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding the theology of music articulated in villancicos can illuminate why and how villancicos were used to propagate faith.
    Doing so will deepen our knowledge of how music general fit into the religious worldview of early modern Catholics.
    For Catholic believers in the Spanish Empire of the seventeenth century, what kind of power did music have to affect the relationship between faith and the sense of hearing?
    If music had supernatural power, how was that power linked to the worldly powers of church and state?
    By engaging interpretively with these villancicos we may gain a better understanding of how early modern Catholics used music for spiritual ends, and how the spiritual intersected with the wordly functions of this music within Spanish society.
  </p>
  <p>
    This book is the first large-scale attempt to understand the theological aspect of seventeenth-century villancicos across the Hispanic world.
    It is also one of only a few studies to analyze villancicos musically in detail.
    Most importantly, the primary goal of the project is to combine these two modes of analysis, to understand how theological beliefs were expressed and shaped through the details of musical composition and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to understand the <term>musical theology</term> of villancicos.
    This term does not mean just a verbal formulation of theological ideas about music by historical figures, and it certainly does not connote a normative theological interpretation from a modern scholar's own personal perspective.
      <!-- TODO more on insider/outsider problem somewhere, with citations -->
    Instead, we may conceive of this historical form of devotional performance as a communal act in which religious ideas and values were performed (put into practice) through musical structures.
    To understand the theological content, we must understand the musical practices; and to make sense of the music, we must seek to hear it as a form of theological expression.

      Overview
    </head>
    
    <!-- TODO revise after actual chapters are finalized -->
    <p>
      This book will explore the musical theology in villancicos in three parts.
      Part I (chapters 1 and 2) argues that villancicos on the subject of music may be interpreted as sources for historical theologies of music.
      It considers how certain conceptual problems regarding music's role in the relationship between faith and hearing manifested in this genre, and proposes a historically grounded model for understanding these pieces theologically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first chapter in part I introduces the category of metamusical villancico in its several subtypes, using examples by composers who will be discussed further in the rest of the book.
      The chapter traces the roots of the interpretive approach in this book within musicology and several other disciplines, and clarifies the project's relationship to existing scholarship on villancos and early modern sacred music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second chapter argues that the relationship between hearing and faith was theological problem in seventeenth-century Spain.
      Catholics had to balance the desire to make faith accommodate the sense of hearing with the need to train the sense of hearing.
      Hearing had to be shaped by faith in order to perceive the content of faith.
      To understand music's role in connecting hearing and faith, the chapter examines how villancicos that represent the senses, sensory confusion, and sensory impairment manifest theological concepts of perception.
      The chapter situates villancicos within a Neoplatonic understanding of hearing and music and outlines three primary theological functions of villancicos, each of which requires a different kind of listening practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part II (chapters 3--6) presents detailed case studies of individual pieces, or pieces in specific traditions and places, on themes of heavenly music.
      These pieces constitute <q>singing about singing</q>.
      Chapters 3 and 4 each interpret a single villancico tradition that represents earthly music as a Neoplatonic reflection of heavenly music.
      Chapter 3 focuses on a piece from Puebla in colonial Mexico, and chapter 4 traces a web of settings connected to a villancico from Montserrat in Catalonia.
      Both pieces develop the theological trope of Christ as the <term>verbum Infans</term>&mdash;the <q>unspeaking/infant Word</q> whose incarnate body is itself the highest form of music, harmonizing divine and human.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapters 5 and 6 present groups of pieces from specific locations (Segovia and Zaragoza region) that demonstrate a shift in theological understandings of music, where earthly music is seen as more an expression of human affects than as a reflection of heavenly order.
      <!-- TODO more on Irizar and on Zaragoza -->
      All four chapters in part II also demonstrate that these metamusical villancicos functioned as a special subgenre in which composers could demonstrate their own mastery within the context of a lineage of composition and a tradition of treatments of this theme of heavenly music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part III (chapters 7 and 8) focuses on how the musical theology of villancicos was developed in coordination with the Spanish projects of colonizing and civilizing in the New World.
      Chapter 7 looks at the relationship of Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla's Christmas villancico cycles (extant from 1651--1659) and the building of Puebla Cathedral (consecrated 1649).
      It argues that Padilla's villancico cycles construct a utopian microcosm of hierarchical colonial society.
      The chapter focuses on Padilla's representations of people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, such as Indians and black slaves, in a piece from 1652.
      Especially through the interplay of language and musical rhythm, this composer and his ensemble constructed a world in which every member of colonial society was put into its proper hierarchical place, in a combination of Neoplatonic music theory and ethics.
      <!-- TODO Will there be two chapters on Puebla, or will the scope of the one be increased? -->
      The final chapter draws general conclusions and points to directions for future work.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO Description of score appendix or accompanying anthology depending on publisher situation -->
    <p>
      Accompanying this text is an anthology of the scores most thoroughly discussed in the book, together with their poetic texts and annotated translations.
      These music and poetry editions are an integral part of this project of interpretation and communication; the book will not be coherent without constant reference to these sources.
      Most of these have never been edited before, and a few now receive their first critical, corrected editions.
      The English translations are among the first translations of seventeenth-century villancico poems into any language.
    </p>
    
    <!-- TODO nonsequitur -->
    <p>
      To begin, then, we must consider what metamusical villancicos are and what they reveal about seventeenth-century theological concepts of music.

      Music about Music in the Villancico Genre
    </head>
    
    <p>
      The villancicos studied in this book refer in some way to music.
      Some focus on making music; others on hearing it.
      As such, these pieces constitute music that refers to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we say that a villancico is <q>music about music</q>, the two instances of <mentioned>music</mentioned> in this label have multiple meanings.
      The first <mentioned>music</mentioned> refers to a specific villancico as a musical entity, which includes the performance instructions encoded in notation, the music as it sounds when performed (generalizing from various possible interpretations and guessing about elements of performance not recorded in notation), and also the piece as it existed in history, such as its first known performance in a particular place.
      By the second term <mentioned>music</mentioned> we may mean several things depending on the piece in question: it could mean other sounding music (the <term>musica instrumentalis</term> of Boethius) that the villancico imitates or to which the piece alludes, quotes, or pays homage, as in musical topics and tropes.
      It could also mean music as an abstract concept, which can hve increasing levels of abstractions along a Neoplatonic chain ascending to the <soCalled>Music</soCalled> of the Triune Godhead itself.
      The essential point is that metamusical villancicos create a link between two kinds or levels of music: the music performed and heard points beyond itself to other kinds of music, human or celestial.
    </p>
    <p>
      A global survey of villancico poems and music reveals nine main categories of metamusical villancicos.
      This non-exhaustive survey was drawn from archival musical and poetic sources and form listings in catalogs and published studies (see the bibliography under <q>Primary Sources</q>), covering a global range of sources.
      The survey found more than nine hundred extant, cataloged villancicos that reference metamusical themes, a number that only hints at the original size of this repertoire.
      Table <ptr target="#table:survey-metamusical-topics"/> lists the most common topics in order of frequency.
      We will consider select examples of pieces in each category, beginning with two exemplary villancicos in which several of these topics are found together.

	Pieces with Multiple Topics: Padilla and Cererols
      </head>

      <p>
	It is common to find references to several of these topics in a single piece, and looking at two typical examples of this sort will begin to make clear what is meant by metamusical villancicos.
	The first example is a villancico from the 1652 Christmas cycle (MEX-Pc: Leg. 1/2) written for the Cathedral of Puebla de los Ángeles by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (ca. 1590&ndash;1664).
	<note place="end">
	  Many scholars use the full surname Gutiérrez de Padilla, but it will be convenient throughout the dissertation to refer to this composer the way the Puebla manuscripts do, as simply <q>Padilla</q>.
	  <!-- TODO ref to later chapters discussing Padilla -->
	</note>
	In just the first seven lines of this anonymous text, the villancico refers to sound, voices, singing, choirs, dancing, birds, and solmization (poem <ptr target="#poem:En_la_gloria_de_un_portalillo"/>).
