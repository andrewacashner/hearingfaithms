    The genre originated as a courtly entertainment in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, similar to <term>formes fixes</term> like the <term>frottola</term> and later more similar to the <term>madrigal</term>.
    It likely drew on roots in oral traditions of poetic recitation and popular song.
    In the last decades of the sixteenth century, villancicos, some of whic had always had religious content, came to be performed in and around church liturgies, especially in connection with sacred dramas.
    By the early seventeenth century the villancico had become a predominantly liturgical and paraliturgical genre.

    In function, villancicos were performed most frequently in sets of eight or more pieces, interspersed after the Lessons in the liturgy of Matins, and either following or substituting for the singing of the Latin Responsories, depending on local custom.
