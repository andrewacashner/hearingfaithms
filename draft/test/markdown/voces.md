# Listening for Unhearable Music

## "Voices of the Chapel Choir" and the "Unspeaking Word" (Gutiérrez de Padilla) 

In the setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, the
first of two choruses in the polychoral ensemble begins with this admonition:

> "Voices of the chapel choir, keep count with what is sung, 
> for the King is a musician, and takes note of even the most venial dissonances, 
> after the manner of David the monarch, 
> just as in the manner of Jesus the infant prince."

As the voices declaim these words together like a solemn choral recitative,
breaking the chordal texture only for a mild dissonant suspension of the words
*light dissonances*, the other chorus is literally counting twenty-seven
measures of rests until their entrance.

Thus begins a tour-de-force of music about music, in which the composer and his
ensemble take a verbal discourse about music and turn it into a musical
discourse about music.
Moreover, even as this discourse is referrring through music to the music that
is currently being performed and heard, this discourse is not only about
sounding music or *musica instrumentalis*.

###  Christ as Music in the Poem

Any consideration of this complex piece should begin with a careful reading of
the poetic text and listening to the musical setting (even better, singing or
playing it).[@Cashner:PhD]
It will probably be readily apparent that this is a different type of
villancico entirely from the comic villancicos more commonly heard in recent
performances and recordings.
The poem, whose author is unknown, is so elaborately contrived that it may seem
completely unintelligible at the first encounter. 
There is, indeed, no simple way to approach the text: anywhere one starts one
immediately becomes tangled in a thicket of ambiguous references and cryptic
phrases, and it is not possible to understand the text fully without reading it
as the distillation of tropes and doctrines developed through centuries of
theological literature and liturgy.
The piece demands a high level of intellectual engagement to tease out the
intricate conceit, and may thus be compared with what Bernardo Illari describes
as "enigma" villancicos.[@Illari:Polychoral, vol. 2, 304--308]

Part of its difficulty comes from the widespread influence of the poetry of Luis
de Góngora, who played a similar role for Spanish literature on both sides of
the Atlantic to that of Giambattista Marino in Italian letters, as the
originator of a new aesthetic (referred to as *barroco* by Spanish literary
scholars) <!--- namely? -->
that emphasized learned artifice and highly wraught dramatic effects.
Gongoresque poets like the author of *Voces* reveled in arcane plays
on words, contorted Latinate syntax, and multiple levels of
meanings.[^conceptismo]

[//]: # new aesthetic as opposed to what?

To begin simply, though, this poem represents the tradition of Spanish
*conceptismo*, in which the poet creates a sustained analogy between at
least two different things such that the understanding of each one informs the
other.
Here the two elements are music---specifically choral singing---and the
Incarnate Christ at his birth.
