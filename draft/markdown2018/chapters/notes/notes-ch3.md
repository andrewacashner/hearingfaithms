Within the Spanish literary tradition of *conceptismo*, in which, under a
single governing conceit, a poem may be read in two or more ways simultaneously,
these metamusical pieces create a parallel discourse on music and theology by
playing on the rich symbolic heritage of musical words and concepts.
In the terms of Boethius, these pieces use *musica instrumentalis* to point
beyond themselves to higher forms of music---to the *musica humana*, the
harmony of body and soul, and of human society; *musica mundana*, the
harmony of the planetary and astral spheres; and even beyond the material world,
to the music of the *cielo Empyreo* (Empyrean or Heaven as oposed to *heavens* or sky).
At that higher level, these pieces evoke the song of saints and angels, and even
the mysterious harmonies of the Godhead: three persons in one Trinity, and the
two natures of Christ as man and God.


Before further analysis we should note that this poem is part of a family of
related texts, in a tradition in which texts were varied creatively for each new
musical setting; this interpretation is based on the particular version set by
Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for Puebla in 1657.
We will focus first on the poem, but it is important to remember that this
version of the poem is only available in the musical partbooks, and the music 
shapes how we hear the poem even at a basic level of punctuation and the
structure of lines and strophes.



In an allegorical commentary on the liturgy, which was disseminated in
manuscript and print versions across the Hispanic world---including copies in
Puebla---Guillelmus Durandus called the whole time from the fall of Adam to the
birth of Christ, including the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness and
Babylonian captivity, the *tempus peregrinationis*.
[@Wright:Maze, 234]


[^estribillo-vs-emblems]:
This is a common practice in villancicos: a puzzling idea presented at the
beginning of the piece is not fully explained until the end of the coplas,
so that when the estribillo is then repeated, the listener can hear it with
new understanding.
^[ formal relationships here, diss p. 145 **XXX** ]
In many villancico poems, the relationship of estribillo and coplas is
similar to that between the image and accompanying texts in contemporary
emblem books (@Covarrubias:Emblemas).
In the emblem book of Covarrubias, the emblem is often striking but cryptic,
juxtaposing (for example) two well-known symbols in an unusual way, often
with a Latin motto.
On the facing page is a poem that expands on the ideas in the image, and on
the reverse of that page is a prose explanation of both the poem and the
image.
In this villancico text, then, the estribillo's function is similar to the
purpose of the emblem and poem as presenting attention-getting but enigmatic
symbols, while the coplas share the more explanatory function of the emblem
book's prose.
Just as one would read the explanation and then turn back to consider the
emblem again, now with a heightened sense of meaning, so too in the
villancico, when the estribillo is repeated after the coplas, listeners have
the opportunity to reconsider what they have heard in light of the coplas.

### Theology

Cornelius á Lapide emphasizes the same kind of awe-filled devotion even in the
learned genre of a Latin Biblical commentary: "The Word was made flesh, God was
made man, the Son of God was made the son of a Virgin.  
This \[...\] was of all God's works the greatest and best, such that it
stupefied and stupefies the angels and all the saints."
> In this God demonstrated his full power by uniting man to God, the mire to the
> Word, the earth to heaven; and showed his full wisdom, since the one who could
> not suffer and redeem us in his divinity, put on flesh in the Virgin, since in
> flesh he could suffer and make satisfaction for our sins to God the Father;
> and his full justice, so that by the dignity of his person, as one equal to
> God, he satisfied God's wrath and vengeance by dying on the cross; and all his
> goodness, which he poured out completely in order to give away his gifts to
> us; "For he was made the son of men, so that he might make us sons of God,"
> says Saint Augustine. 
> "He was born on the earth, so that man might be reborn  into heaven," as Saint
> Gregory says.
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 50, on Mt 1:16:
"q. d. Verbum caro factum est, Deus factus est homo, Filius Dei factus est
Filius Virginis.
Hoc, \[...\] fuit omnium Dei operum summum et maximum, ideoque illud stupuerunt et
stupent Angeli, Sanctique omnes.
In eo enim Deus ostendit summam potentiam uniendo hominem Deo, limum Verbo,
terram coelo: ac summam sapientiam, ut qui divinitate pati et nos redimere non
poterat, carnem in Virgine indueret, qua pati, et pro peccatis nostris Deo Patri
satisfacere posset: summam quoque justititiam, quia ob dignitatem personae, ex
aequo quasi Dei irae et vindictae moriendo in cruce satisfecit: summam etiam
bonitatem, quia semetipsum exinanivit, ut nos suis donis repleret: *Ac factus
est filius hominis, ut nos efficeret filios Dei*, ait S. August. *Natus est in
terra, ut homo nasceretur in coelo*, ut ait S. Gregorius."]

In a similar passage in his Latin Biblical commentary, Cornelius á Lapide goes
even further to speak of being "stupefied" and "struck deaf" \[*attonitus*\] at
the sight of Christ in the manger.
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 672, on Lk 2:7:
"Christus enim in praesepio, hoc est Jesu homo, Verbum infans, est amor, aeque ac
stupor omnium angelorium ac fidelium, quod omnes stupent et stupebunt per omnem
aeternitatem.
Quis enim non attonitus stupeat, si profunde hunc puerum inspiciat, eumque
rogat, Quis es tu, ô parvule Bethlehemitice? eumque audiat respondentem: Disce
id ex Isaia cap. 9. 6. *Parvulus natus est nobis, et filius datus est nobis*,
etc."]

It is probably no accident that the phrase *lo que se canta* in the opening
sentence of the poem corresponds literally to a phrase used by Augustine in the
famous passage about listening to music in the *Confessions*.
Augustine confesses that he sins when "it happens to me that the song moves me
more than what is sung"
[@Augustine:ConfessionesPL, 10:33:
"Tamen, cum mihi accidit ut me amplius cantus, quam res quae canitur, moveat;
poenaliter me peccare confiteor, et tunc mallem non audire cantantem."]
A popular version translates, "It is not the singing that moves me but the
meaning of the words when they are sung."
[@Augustine:ConfessionsPenguin, 239]
But Augustine's dilemma is not between words and music, but between different
ways of hearing music.
Augustine twice in this passage uses the same words contrasting *cantus* (song)
with *res quae canitur*, literally "the thing that is sung."
This choice of words connects to Augustine's theology of signs in *De doctrina
christiana*, in which everything in the world is either a *res* (thing, object)
or a *signum* (sign) that points to a *res*.
The "song," then, would be the sign that points to "what is sung"---a concept
that need not be limited to the words of the song, but should be understood
within the context of Augustine's Christian Neoplatonism, referring to a
higher reality as the object of the song. 
Augustine is confessing that he failed to rise in contemplation from the created
world to its Creator, that is, because of his sensual appetites he failed to
discern the sensory world (the song that he hears) as a sign pointing to the
ultimate *res* or being to which all lesser things owe their existence, the Holy
Trinity.
In the villancico, "what is sung" refers first to the present-day singing of the
chapel choir, but that itself is a sign pointing to the voices of the first
Christmas and ultimately to Christ who is himself both sign and signified.


Padilla makes the connection of Christ as singer to Christ as song even stronger
through his literal puns of solmization on these syllables.

#### Genealogy

##### Version by Francisco de Santiago, before 1644

To start with the earlier source, the Portuguese monarch possessed a collection
of music that included hundred of villancico settings, many of them by Fray
Francisco de Santiago.
This Carmelite friar, born with the surname Veiga in Portugal, was chapelmaster
at Seville from 1617 to 1643.
[@Stevenson:SantiagoF; @Perez:DMEH-Santiago]
The Seville chapter had commissioned him to filled in for Alonso Lobo during the
elder chapelmaster's illness by composing the *chanzonetas* (villancicos) for
Christmas 1616, and then he was appointed as Lobo's successor.
Likewise, when Santiago himself was incapacitated by a paralyzing medical
condition in 1643, the chapter hired Luis Bernardo Jalón as an interim director
and then appointed him to succeed Santiago after his death in 1644.
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB] ^[XXX  + DMEH sv Sevilla? ]

Santiago had maintained a lifelong association and correspondence with the Duke
of Braganza, who after 1640 reigned as King João IV of Portugal.
Santiago obtained permission from the Seville Cathedral chapter to visit Lisbon
every five years (1625, 1630, 1635, and 1640).
Whether Santiago wrote music specifically for the royal chapel in Lisbon, or
simply brought John IV copies of his music from Seville, the Portuguese monarch
acquired a collection of five hundred thirty-eight villancicos by Santiago, not
to mention other musical genres.
Among the "Christmas Villancicos of Fray Francisco de Santiago" in the catalog
John had compiled and printed in 1649 appears the following title:

> *Vozes las de la capilla. solo. Ya trechos las distancias. a 9*
[@JohnIV:Catalog, caixão 26, no. 674]

Unfortunately only this description remains; the music parts probably perished along
with the rest of the collection in the fires that followed the Lisbon earthquake
of 1755.
No other piece with these incipits has been found in all the catalogs of
villancico poetry imprints.
The incipits match Padilla's text exactly, though Padilla sets the first section
(*introducción*) "a 3" and the second (*estribillo*) "a 6."

<!-- FN to show that this is introduccion and estribillo, cf Anton Llorente in
Sanchez Garza -->

There are several ways that Padilla might have known Santiago's setting of
*Voces* or the poem on which it was based.
It is quite likely that the two chapelmasters knew each other personally from
Padilla's early career in Andalucía.
Padilla, baptized in Málaga in 1590, climbed his way rapidly up the ladder of
prestigious positions in the region.
[@Gembero:Padilla]
He started as a choirboy at Málaga Cathedral, where he studied with chapelmaster
Francisco Vásquez from about 1602--1608.
Padilla's first position was as chapelmaster for the nearby cathedral of Ronda
(1608--1612); then on August 13, 1612, he began as chapelmaster at the
collegiate church of Jerez de la Frontera.
After his teacher Vásquez died, Padilla competed for the position at Málaga but
lost the *oposición* to the Portuguese composer Estêvão de Brito (1577--1641).
[@Stevenson:BritoE]
Padilla stayed at Jerez until he achieved a more coveted position,
chapelmaster at the cathedral of Cádez, where he began March 17, 1616.
He remained until 1622 when he emigrated to New Spain, somehow getting himself
into a position where, like Santiago had done for Lobo and Jalón would do for
Santiago, he was able to fill in for the chapelmaster of Puebla Cathedral
(Gaspar Fernández) in his illness in 1628 and then succeed him in his position
in 1629; he stayed there until his death in 1644, having groomed Juan García de
Céspedes as his own successor.

Padilla's years in Cádiz (1616--1622) overlap with Santiago's tenure in Seville
(1617--1643), leaving about six years when the two chapelmasters could easily
have interacted either thorugh correspondence or personally.
The two port cities, about 121 km apart, were closely linked economically and
socially.
Both cities were among the first to print leaflets of villancico poems, and
Padilla could have had access to the texts set by Santiago through this medium
alone.
[@BNE:VCs17C, s.v. *Cádiz* and *Sevilla*]
These imprints circulated widely and enabled provincial churches to stay
up-to-date with the latest trends; the most widely imitated models, judging from
the evidence of poetry imprints for texts set multiple times, were the Royal
Chapel in Madrid and the cathedral of Seville.
^[XXX such as Sevilla imprints in Puebla ]
Even in there was no personal connection between Padilla and Santiago, the
Seville composer's position at the helm of the flagship music program in the
Hispanic world (in fact, the mother church for all of the Indies), would have
made him a prime target for emulation, homage, or competition.

In fact, Santiago's appoiintment at Seville may have even precipitated Padilla's
departure for the New World.
The pinnacle of achievement for any Spanish composer, particularly one from
Andalucía, would be the chapelmastership at Seville Cathedral.
As Padilla built his early career, he must have had his eye on Seville, knowing
that Alonso Lobo was again and that his position would likely become available
in the next few years.
But when Lobo's health finally failed and Seville Cathedral had to enlist a
replacement before Christmas 1616, the chapter appointed the older and much more
accomplished Francisco de Santiago without publicly advertising the position
(meaning that there was no public *oposición*, as there had been in Málaga in
1612).
Santiago was still young enough that Padilla could safely assume the Seville
position would not again become available for decades.
Padilla had just started his position in Cádez---not a lowly post---but the
appointment of Santiago would have deprived him of any hopes of further
advancement on the Spanish main.
If he had hoped to work for the king, Mateo Romero had been master of the Royal
Chapel since 1598, and would remain so until 1633.
Another esteemed Madrid position, chapelmaster at the royal Convento de la
Encarnación, was given in 1620 to none other than Luis Bernardo Jalón.
This may have been part of the reason why in about 1622, Padilla sought better
opportunities in America.

<!-- ANton Llorente and circumstantial evidence that Santiago's music was known
in Puebla -->

##### Version by Luis Bernardo Jalón, 1647

^[XXX  connect Jalón and *Cantores* to Padilla via Puebla collection ]
The next known villancico in this family is the 1647 poem *Cantores de la
capilla*, performed in Seville, with music probably by Luis Bernardo Jalón.
The text corresponds closely to the text of Padilla's *Voces, las de la
capilla*.
The first four lines of both poems are the same, except that Jalón's text has
*Cantores* (singers) instead of *Voces* (voices) and *Niño* (child) instead of
*Rey* (king).
Most of the last half of the estribillo in the Jalón print is the same as that
set by Padilla, including the identical closing couplet.
Jalón's fourth copla is identical to the end of Padilla's *introducción*.

Though the text of *Cantores* predates that of Padilla's *Voces*,
the citation of a *Voces* setting by Santiago from even earlier combines with
philological evidence to suggest that *Voces* actually preserves an earlier
version of this textual family.
The general trend in mid seventeenth-century Spanish villancico poetry was away
from complex puzzles in the manner of Góngora and toward greater simplicity,
clarity, and conventionality.
Upon close comparison *Cantores* appears to be a somewhat garbled attempt to
simplify the arcanely Gongoresque *Voces* to make it suit the tastes of a
younger generation.

In terms of structure and meter, *Voces* is more intricately patterned than
*Cantores*: it features a *respuesta* section and a *linea de vuelta* joining the
last line of the coplas to the beginning of the estribillo.
The *respuesta* was more commonly used in villancicos before 1640, though
Padilla continues to use it in several pieces of the 1650s.
The *linea de vuelta* was a holdover from the rather different structure of the
courtly villancicos of the sixteenth century, such as those set by Juan del
Encina.
[@Navarro:Metrica, XXX]
Both Padilla's *Voces* and the incipit for Santiago's *Voces* contain the *linea
de vuelta*, "Y a trechos las distancias."
*Cantores*, by contrast, has no *respuesta* and omits this line.

The estribillo of Padilla's *Voces* begins with the *linea de vuelta*, followed
by a series of fully rhymed verse pairs, all in eight-syllable lines.
The half-line "uno a uno" forms a bracket with the other half-line "O qué
canto," marking off this section of paired verses from the closing quatrain, a
*redondilla abrazada*.
By contrast, the estribillo of *Cantores* begins with two lines with neither
assonance nor rhyme, followed by a line that rhymes with nothing and can only
scan as eight syllables if *que* and *lleva* are elided; the fourth line can
only be read as ten syllables.
The next four lines group in pairs with full rhymes, alternating lines of six
and eleven syllables.
These metrical irregularities are confined to this first portion of the
estribillo; after this the remainder is almost identical to *Voces*.
Thus the first section appears "tacked on" to the more refined pre-existing
material in the second section.
^[XXX  line numbers; poem in text? ]

In terms of theological and musical conceits, *Cantores* reads like an attempt
to take the dense *conceptismo* of *Voces* and both simplify and explain it.
The connection of Christ's voice ("the sign of A") and the "voices of the chapel
choir" is obscured, as the opening is changed to "singers of the chapel choir."
The crucial lines from *Voces*, "a la voz del padre oí/ cantar por puntos de
llanto," are missing as well, which makes it harder to make sense of "el signo a
la mi re."
The thematically central second copla of *Voces* is absent from *Cantores*,
obscuring the conceit of God as a musician and the newborn Christ as his
masterwork.
The connection between David and Christ as musician-kings is absent as well.
"The King is a musician" in *Voces* is changed to "the child is a musician"---so
that Christ is now explicitly the creator of the music rather than himself being
the Music *and* the musician.
Throughout the poems, where *Voces* has an ambiguous or cryptic line, *Cantores*
has a less multivalent one: instead of "a la voz del padre oí" *Cantores* has
"con que mil maravillas vi"; instead of "y aguardan tiempo oportuno/ quien antes
del tiempo fue" *Cantores* has "después que aguardaron uno/ que llegó a tiempo
oportuno/ quién antes del tiempo fue."
The *Voces* version of these lines is pithy but a bit arcane; the *Cantores*
version is crystal-clear but requires an extra line to say the same thing.

The *conceptismo* in *Cantores* is not as tight as in *Voces*: in many cases,
*Cantores* makes sense on the musical side but not on the theological side.
Some of the musical terminology is deployed innaccurately, as when *Cantores*
has Christ the composer writing in "compás mayor" in a "proporción abreviada"
using a "clave con tres tiempos"---it is hard to know which actual meters might
be indicated here.
The poet of *Cantores* writes multiple lines like "O que lindamente suenan!/ o
que dulcemente cantan" that do not advance the conceit, where the poet of
*Voces* restrained such effusions to the four-syllable "O qué canto."
The new poet has retained the technical terms and other key words used in the
first version of the poem, but has attempted to explain the metaphors, sometimes
in ways that change the meaning from the first poem.

A good example of this procedure is the way the poet has retained the word
*destreza* in the first portion of the text.
In *Voces*, the poet follows a mention of "the thirty-three" with these lines:
"Años antes la divisa/ la destreza en la esperanza."
The poet of *Cantores* replaces those lines with these:

> Una clave con tres tiempos\
> pone con destreza tanta,\
> que el pasado y el futuro\
> al compás presente iguala.

> He places a clef with three times [meters]\
> with such dexterity\
> that in this meter he makes\
> the past and the future equal the present.

This poet retains a numerological reference based on three, and connects it to
the idea of a "sign" and "destreza" so that the sign clearly indicates a
metrical symbol (ternary meter), and *destreza* now indicates the divine
baby-musician's compositional skill.
The poet does not use *destreza* as a *divisa* or motto as it is in *Voces*,
possibly taken from Tacitus's *spes in virtute*.
All the connotations of swordsmanship and heroic combat (which link to the
Matins reading from Leo the Great) are absent, along with any specific reference
to Christ's future struggle in the Passion.
The term's meaning is reduced to a simply musical one, and the rich theological
associations in *Voces* are lost.

These differences are consistent with the explanation that *Cantores* is an
adaptation of *Voces* to suit less Gongoresque tastes, and that it is not an
especially skillful adaption.
Jalón thus pays homage to Santiago by basing his villancico on the same text,
but also shows his differences from his predecessor by using an "improved"
version of the poem, and, one may imagine, a more modern musical style as well.

Jalón's position at Seville was the culmination of a restlessly ambitious
career.
He had left his post at the Convento de la Encarnación in 1623 to be
chapelmaster of the cathedrals of Burgos (1623--1634), Cuenca (1634--1642), and
Toledo (1642--1643).
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB]
On November 10, 1643, he was appointed chapelmaster at the cathedral of Santiago
de Compostela, but dropped everything a month later when he was invited to
assist Santiago at Seville Cathedral.
Jalón remained there until his death on April 6, 1659.

Jalón was present in Seville for the last year of Santiago's life, from December
1643 until Santiago died on October 5, 1644.
It is easy to imagine that the two composers had close contact during that time,
and in any case, Jalón could have had access to Santiago's music in the
cathedral archive.
Jalón's setting of *Cantores* was performed only two years after Santiago's
death, and it is plausible that Jalón composed the piece deliberately in homage
to his predecessor.
The Christmas--Epiphany season of 1646--47 would likely have been Jalón's first
opportunity to do something in Santiago's memory.
He was hired as an emergency substitute only a month before the musically
demanding feasts of the 1634--44 Christmas season, and it would seem likely that
the music for that first Christmas season would have been already chosen by
Santiago, or drawn from material Jalón had at hand and could put together
quickly.
Santiago died the following October, by which time the music for the 1644--45
feast would likely have been planned or even composed.
(For comparison, as will be shown in chapter 4, Miguel de Irízar in Segovia
composed all his villancicos for Christmas 1689 after September of that year,
based on poems available to him nine months previous.)
In any case, the close interval of time between Santiago's death and Jalón
setting of *Cantores* strengthens the argument that Jalón may have composed the
piece as a deliberate homage.

^[XXX  START Epiphany changes diss p 215 ]
Some changes in Jalón's setting bear evidence of adaptation for use in the
liturgy of Matins for Epiphany 1647 in Seville.
Where *Voces* alludes to the presence of angels, animals, and shepherds at the
manger, *Cantores* explicitly includes the "three Kings" as well in copla 3.
The slightly greater emphasis on the heavens, and on the concept of time
(musical and theological), might also be intended to connect with the visit of
these mysterious astrologers from the East.
But other aspects of the adaptation actually seem to make it *less* well suited
for Epiphany, in particular the omission of the line "a la voz del padre oí."
According to this piece's placement in the poetry imprint, as the second in a
cycle of nine villancicos, *Cantores* would have been paired with this
Responsory, drawn from the Gospel narratives of Christ's baptism (Mt. 3:13--17,
Mk. 1:9--11, Lk. 3:21--22, Jn. 1:32):

> *Respond.* In the form of a dove the Holy Spirit was seen, the voice of the
> Father was heard: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\
> *Versicle.* The heavens were opened above him, and the voice of the Father
> intoned. This is my beloved Son.
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, XXX:
"*Respond.* In columbæ specie Spiritus sanctus visus est, paterna vox audita
est:
\* Hic est Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi bene complácui.
*Versicle.* Cȩli aperti sunt super eum, & vox Patris intónuit. Hic est Filius."]


This chant would match well with the line about hearing "the voice of the
Father" in Padilla's *Voces*, when the piece was likely repeated with the other
1657 Christmas villancicos for Epiphany in January 1658 (with the typical
substitution of the villancico *de Reyes* for Epiphany instead of the *calenda*
that began the Christmas cycle).
But would be to the discredit of either the poet or composer of *Cantores de la
capilla*, performed in conjunction with this specific Responsory, that such a
key line, not only for the theology of the poem but for its place in the
liturgy, should have been cut.
It seems likely, then, that this version of the text was not devised for this
specific liturgical placement, just for the feast of Kings in general, and Jalón
selected the arrangement in the Matins cycle based on fairly loose theological
criteria.
^[XXX  Responsory performance in Sevilla? ]
The piece did not need to be a perfect fit liturgically in order to fulfill the
dual function of paying homage to Santiago while also demonstrating Jalón's own
position representing the new generation, the next step in the tradition at
Seville.

##### Establishing a Musical Pedigree
^[XXX  already used this ]

It is highly probable that Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla owned or had access to the
text of *Cantores de la capilla* from Seville.
The print with the text of *Cantores* is actually preserved only in a single
source located in Puebla.
It is part of a binder's collection of villancico imprints of the 1630s and
1640s from Seville.
The volume is held in an anonyous private collection in Puebla, and according to
Gustavo Mauleón Rodríguez, who is cataloging these holdings, this binder's
collection was originally bound with another collection of Seville villancicos
which is preserved in Puebla's Biblioteca Lafragua; both bear the firemark of
Puebla's Convento de la Merced and appear to be two parts of one original
volume.
^[XXX  check with Mauleón; Lafragua source ]
There are several correspondences between the villancico texts in the Lafragua
collection and those used by Padilla in the 1650s.
^[XXX  for example ]
These connections suggest that Padilla himself was familiar with these pliegos.
Padilla regularly used texts of peninsular imprints, such as his 1653 *A la
jacara, jacarilla*, taken from a Madrid Royal Chapel imprint of a year earlier
(E-Mn: VE/88/55).
Padilla likely kept his own collection of imprints (if not this actual
collection) as sources for composition, keeping current with the latest mainland
trends.

If Jalón's villancico was a modernization of Santiago's, then, and the text was
available to Padilla in New Spain through the imprint, why did Padilla choose to
set Santiago's original text (or an older tradition similar to it) rather than
the new one set by Jalón?
One possibility is that Padilla specifically wanted to differentiate himself
from Jalón and associate himself more directly with Santiago.
With his setting of *Voces, las de la capilla*, Padilla may have been trying to
show that he, not Jalón, was the true successor to Santiago.
Padilla was not able to capture the coveted position of Seville chapelmaster in
1616, so he may have wanted to demonstrate that he was carrying on the great
legacy of Santiago and his peers in the New World.
The modifications in *Cantores de la capilla* suggest that Jalón represented a
new generation and a new style, and his music was likely in a newer style than
that of Padilla.
^[XXX  any sources? ]
In 1657, Padilla was sixty-seven years old; only three years later, on account
of dangerously poor health, he had to write a "power of attorney" giving legal
rights to Juan García de Céspedes, who (like Padilla had done for Fernández) had
been serving as Padilla's assistant and would later succeed him.
[@Mauleon:PadillaCivil, XXX]
Padilla's setting of the older text may have represented the aging composer's
attempt to demonstrate an affinity with the older generation.

This chain of homage may shed light on the origins and meaning of Padilla's most
performed piece of Latin-texted music today, the *Missa "Ego flos campi"* for
eight voices.[^Padilla-Ego-flos-campi]
The piece has been assumed to be a parody mass bassed on a lost motet *Ego flos
campi* by Padilla.
But John IV's catalog lists another *Missa "Ego flos campi" a 8*---by Francisco de
Santiago.
Moreover, the catalog specifies that Santiago's mass was based on the motet *Ego
flos campi a 8* by Nicolas Dupont, a Flemish composer in the Spanish Royal
Chapel.
[@JohnIV:Catalog, 417, caixão 34, no. 787: "Missas [...] Ego flos campi, a 8.
*Ferta sobre hum Motette de Niculas du Pont*"; @JohnIV:Catalog, 381, caixão 32,
no. 767: "Ego flos campi, a 8, Niculas du Pont. *De Nossa Senhora*."
Based on this connection, Robert Stevenson speculated that Santiago, like his
peer Diego de Pontac, studied with Nicolas Dupont during Santiago's time in
Madrid; -@Stevenson:SantiagoF.]
(Neither piece has been found.)
For Santiago to use this music by Dupont, who may have been one of his teachers
in Madrid, was to connect himself to the august lineage of Hapsburg
Franco-Flemish composers going back to Dufay and Ockeghem.
It is possible, then, that Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla's *Missa "Ego flos campi"*
is not based on his own motet, but on Santiago's mass of the same name, and that
this represents another instance of Padilla establishing his musical pedigree.

This type of homage was a customary way for a student to identify himself with a
teacher or paragon, as we will see several more times in this study.
In fact, a similar homage was payed to Padilla by his organist, Francisco
Vidales.
According to John Koegel, "The Puebla organist Francisco de Vidales used
Padilla's *Exultate justi in Domino* as the model for his parody *Missa super
Exultate*, and another connection between the two men is seen in Vidales's
addition of a tenor part to Padilla's *O Domine Jesu Christe*."

Dianne Goldman has documented a similar chain of homage in several stages of
reworking a Victoria motet at Mexico City Cathedral through the eighteenth
century.^[cite Goldman stile antico article]
