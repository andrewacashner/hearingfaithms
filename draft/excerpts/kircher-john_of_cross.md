Excerpts from *Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in
Devotional Music of the Spanish Empire* (Book in progress), 2018

## Athanasius Kircher, *Musurgia universalis* (Rome, 1650)

Kircher discusses the power of music several times throughout his ten-part
treatise, including a detailed analysis of "whether, why, and what kind of power
music might have to move people's souls, and whether the stories are true that
were written about the miraculous effects of ancient music." 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. 7, p. 549: 
"Vtrum, cur, & quomodo Musica uim habeat ad animos hominum commouendos, & vtrum
vera sint, quæ de mirificis Musicæ Veteris effectibus scribuntur."]
Kircher's contribution to this favorite controversy of the Renaissance is to
defend the superiority of modern music on the basis of, among other factors, its
increased ability to move listeners through varieties of musical structure and
style. 

For Kircher, music added such power to words, that it could move a listener not
only to understand the subject of the words, but to physically experience their
truth. 
According to legend the famed *aulos* player Timotheus aroused Alexander the
Great to the furor of war through music, and Kircher says he did this by
adapting his song both to the feeling of war and to the disposition of the king.
[Kircher is probably responding to @Galilei:Dialogo, 90, in discussing the
Classical source, Dio Chrysostom, *Orationes* 1 (*Peri Basileias*); a later
treatment of this subject is @Dryden:Alexander.]
The same music, he says, would have had a different effect on someone else.
To illustrate this contrast, Kircher goes on to paint a remarkable picture of
how sacred music can move those who are disposed to it:

> If, on the other hand, [the musician] addressed the sort of man who was
> devoted to God and dedicated to meditation on heavenly things, and wished to
> move him in otherworldly affects and rapture of the mind, he would take up
> some notable theme expressed in words---a theme that would recall to the
> listener's memory the sweetness and mildness of heavenly things---and he would
> fittingly adapt it in the Dorian mode through cadences and intervals, then
> [the listener] would experience that what was said was actually true, those
> heavenly things that were made by harmonic sweetness, and he would suddenly be
> carried away beyond himself to that place where those joyful things are
> true. 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. 7, p. 550: "Sicuti contra, si quis Deo deuotum hominum
rerumque cœlestium, meditationi deditum in exoticos affectus raptusque mentis
commouere vellet is supra insigne aliquod verborum thema, quod rerum cælestium
dulcedinem, & suauitatem auditori in memoriam reuocaret, modulo dorio per
clausulas interuallaque aptè adaptet, & experietur quod dixi verum esse, statim
extra se factos dulcedine harmonica eò, vbi vera sunt gaudi rapi: vidi ego
nonsemel in viris ordinis nostri sanctitate illustribus huiusmodi
experimenta."]

Kircher says that the experience of Jesuit missionaries around the world
provides ample evidence of this miraculous power of music combined with
preaching. 
But Kircher's depiction of music's power in this passage goes well beyond the
Jesuit formula of "teaching, pleasing, and persuading."
[On the Jesuit approach to religious arts, see @Bailey:Art, 35--51.]
Music not only makes the teaching of doctrinal truth appealing and persuasive;
it actually transforms listeners through affective experience. 

In this conception, music links the objective truth with subjective experience
through the unique ways that music affects the human body. 
Kircher posits that music moves a listener's soul through the principle of
sympathy.
[On the links between this interest in the occult powers of music and early
scientific research, see @Gouk:Sciences; @Gouk:Harmonics.]
Just as a string plucked on one lute would cause a string tuned to the same
pitch on another lute to vibrate, music created physical harmony---sympathetic
vibration---between the affective content of the music and the humors of the
person listening.
When the music moved in the same way as the affections it expressed, this in
turn moved the listener to feel the same affections.
[Kircher's theory bears a striking resemblance to some recent theories of music
cognition, such as Lawrence Zbikowski's description of musical structures as
"sonic analogues for internal dynamic processes"; -@Zbikowski:Conceptualizing,
XX.]

Kircher explains:

> Since harmony is nothing other than the concord, agreement, and mutually
> corresponding proportion between dissimilar voices, this proportion, then, of
> numbers, sets the air in motion; the motion, indeed, is to be varied by the
> ratios of various intervals, ascending and descending; so that the spirits 
> [i. e., *spiritus animales*], or the implanted internal air [...], should be
> moved according to the proportions of the motion of the external air, so that
> the spirits' motion are effected in various ways; and through this affections
> can be engendered in the person.
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 552: "Cum harmonia nihil aliud sit, quam dissimilium vocum
concordia, consensus, & undequaque correspondens proportio; proportio autem
numerorum in motu aeris elucescat; motus verò pro varia interuallorum, ascensus,
descensusque ratione varius sit, spiritus quoque, siue aer internus implantatus,
vti paulò ante ostensum fuit, iuxta proportionem motus aeris extrinseci
moueatur, fit vt spiritus moti ope varie, indè in homini affectiones
nascantur."]

Kircher seems to assume that the affective properties of different modes and
styles of music are inherent in the numerical proportions of the music; in other
words, the affective character of the music he describes in the Dorian mode
would always be the same.
Music with different intervallic relationships, with the semitone placed
differently in different modes, had different affective content.
But because music's power depended on sympathetic resonance, the *effect* of
music was dependent on the relationship between that objective affective content
and the subjective disposition of an individual listener.
The structure of the music's movements must correspond to the movements of the
body's humors. 
Kircher theorizes that four conditions are necessary for music to achieve an
effect; without any one, music will fail to move the listener in the intended
way:

> The first is harmony itself. Second, number, and proportion. Third, the power
> and efficacy of the words to be pronounced in music itself; or, the oration.
> Fourth is the disposition of the hearers, or the subject's capacity to
> remember things. 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550: 
"Tertius purè naturalis est, per harmonicum, scilicet sonum, qui nisi quatuor
conditiones annexas habeat, quarum vna deficiente, desideratus effectus minimé
obtinebitur: Prima est ipsa harmonia. Secunda, numerus, & proportio. Tertia,
verborum in ipsa musica prouniciandorum vis, & efficacia, siue ipsa oratio.
Quarta audientis dispositio, siue subiectum memoratarum rerum capax."]

If there must be this kind of congruence between music and listener, then it
makes sense that Kircher acknowledges that music affects different people in
different ways. 
First, Kircher concedes that geographic and cultural factors influence music
style and its effect, such that Italians and Germans are moved by different
styles and therefore compose differently. 
These national styles, he says, are the result of a national "genius" (that is,
the special gift of that people), as well as environmental factors, such that
Germans draw a grave style from living in a cold climate, contrasted with the
more moderate style of Italians. 
People of the Orient who visit Rome, Kircher says, do not enjoy the highly
delicate music of that city, and prefer their own strident, clangorous music.
These differences of style and perception are caused by patriotism---the
inordinate love of things from one's own country, as Kircher describes it; and
by what each person is accustomed to hearing, which is shaped by the traditions
of each country. 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 543--544]
<!---  translation in Strunk -->

Moreover, "just as different nations enjoy a different style of music, likewise
within each nation, people of different temperaments appreciate different styles
that conform the most to their natural inclinations." 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 544:
"Quod quemadmodum diversæ nationes diuerso stylo musico gaudent, ita & in
vnaquaque natione diuersi temperamenti homines, diuersis stylis, vnusquisque suæ
naturali inclinationi maximè conformibus afficiuntur."]
What delights a person with a sanguine temperament might enrage or madden a
melancholic listener; what has a strong effect on one person may have no effect
at all on another. 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550]
"Music does not just move any subject, but the one with which the natural humor
of the music is congruent [...] for unless the spirits of the receiving subject
correspond exactly, the music accomplishes nothing." 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550:
"Musica igitur vt moueat, non qualecunque subiectum vult, sed illud cuius humor
naturalis musicae congruit [...] quæ nisi recipientis subiecti spiritui extactè
respondeant, nihil efficient."]
Furthermore, Kircher suggests that not only humoral temperament but also training
and intelligence are a factor in individual listening, since he includes the
capacity of memory in his list of four conditions for effective music. 

Despite Kircher's confidence in modern musicians' ability to make music music
move people, the conditions he names may not have been as easy to fulfill as he
suggests. 
There must be congruence, first of all, between the structure of the music and
subject of that music: the music must move in the same way as the affective
movements it seeks to incite. 
Harmonic ratios, metrical proportions, verbal rhetoric---all of these must
align, but they were still not enough without the fourth condition, the
disposition of the hearer. 
The listener must have a humoral temperament that is moved in the desired way by
the music. 

## St. John of the Cross, *The Ascent of Mount Carmel* (Granada, ca. 1560, pub. 1618)

Spanish theological writers cultivated disciplines for regulating
spiritual experiences and submitting individual sensation to the Church's
authority. 
The Spanish Inquisition investigated Teresa of Ávila and other mystics who
claimed authority only on the basis of spiritual experiences, and most were not
as successful as Teresa in avoiding punishment.
[@Ahlgren:TeresaPolitics; @Francisca:Inquisition]
Teresa's student Juan de la Cruz (St. John of the Cross) taught contemplatives
to pursue union with God by weaning themselves of sensory experiences in the
"dark night of the soul." 
The Carmelite reformer defines that union not in sensual terms but in ethical
ones, as the total surrender and conformity of one's will to God.
[@Schreiner:Certainty; @JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. I, ch. 5--7, pp. 226--248]
<!-- Carmelite secondary -->
Similarly, Ignatius of Loyola provided Jesuits with his *Spiritual Exercises*
for discerning the validity of their religious sensations, and for using those
experiences to make decisive changes in life, as part of a radical commitment of
the self to God. 
[@Schreiner:Certainty, ch. 6]
<!-- Ignatius primary and secondary -->

In such a climate, music might be used for the purposes of cultivating faith,
because of its power over the senses and affections, but this power could also
be dangerous.
Some Catholics such as the Jesuit missionaries, despite their founder's
suspicion of music, were eager to use this power to advance the cause of the
Church. 
On the mission field, the Jesuits were involved with subjective experience to
such a degree that they even interpreted the dreams of native people in New
Spain. 
[@Bailey:Art]
Others, though, saw the use of music as a potential distraction or distortion. 
For example, Juan de la Cruz complains that even though churches would seem the
ideal place for prayer, their decorations, ceremonies, and music so engage a
person's senses that it can be impossible to worship God "in spirit and in
truth" (John 4:23-24). 
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 39--45, pp. 415--424]

Juan warns that desiring "to feel some effect on oneself" in doing elaborate
ceremonies "is no less than to tempt God and provoke him gravely; so much so,
that sometimes it gives license to the devil to deceive them, making them feel
and understand things far removed from what is good for their soul."
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 43, p. 420: 
"Y lo que es peor es que algunos quieren sentire algún efecto en sí, o cumplirse
lo que piden, o saber que se cumple el fin de aquellas sus oraciones
ceremoniáticas; que no es menos que tentar a Dios y enojarle gravemente; tanto,
que algunas veces da licencia al demonio para que los engañe, haciéndolos sentir
y entender cosas harto ajenas del provecho de su alma, mereciéndolos ellos por
la propiedad que llevan en sus oraciones, no deseando más que se haga lo que
Dios quiere que lo que ellos pretenden."]
In a strong counterpoint to Kircher's statement about music's power to augment
preaching, Juan admonishes his readers to be wary of overly artful preaching
which, like music, only serves to stimulate "the sense and understanding"---Juan
uses the exact language of the Roman Catechism---but has no impact on the
hearer's will to live faithfully:

> How commonly we see that [...] if the preacher's life is better, greater is
> the fruit that he gains though his style be low and his rhetoric scanty, and
> his teaching common, because the living spirit infuses him with ardor; but the
> other preacher gets very little gain, no matter how much more elevated his
> style and doctrine may be: because, though it is true that good style and
> actions and elevated doctrine and good language move and create more effect
> when accompanied by a good spirit, without the spirit, though the sermon may
> give the sense and understanding much to savor and enjoy, it infuses little or
> no sustenance to the spirit, because commonly it remains as lax and loath as
> before to labor, even though marvelous things were said in marvelous ways,
> which only serve to delight the ear [*oído*], like some polyphonic music [*una
> música concertada*] or the clanging of bells [...]. It matters little to hear
> someone perform one kind of music that is better than some other, if it does
> not move me more than the other to do works; because, although they have
> spoken marvels, then they are forgotten, as they do not infuse fire into the
> will.
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 45, p. 425: 
"Que comúnmente vemos que---cuanto acá podemos juzgar---cuanto el predicador es
de mejor vida, mayor es el fruto que hace por bajo que sea su estilo, y poca su
retórica, y su doctrina común, porque del espíritu vivo se pega el calor; pero
el otro muy poco provecho hará, aunque más subido sea su estilo y doctrina;
porque, aunque es verdad que el buen estilo y acciones y subida doctrina y buen
lenguaje mueven y hacen más efecto acompañado de buen espíritu; pero sin él,
aunque da sabor y gusto el sermón al sentido y al entendimiento, muy poco o nada
de jugo pega a la voluntad, porque comúnmente se queda tan floja y remisa como
antes para obrar, aunque haya dicho maravillosas cosas maravillosamente dichas,
que sólo sirven para deleitar el oído, como una música concertada o sonido de
campanas; mas el espíritu, como digo, no sale de sus quicios más que antes, no
teniendo la voz virtud para resucitar al muerto de su sepultura. 
Poco importa oír una música mejor que otra sonar, si no me mueve ésta más que
aquélla a hacer obras; porque, aunque hayan dicho maravillas, luego se olvidan,
como no pegaron fuego en la voluntad."]

This passage of warning comes at the end of Juan's encyclopedic treatment of
contemplative practice and mystical experience, and it seems to deliberately
echo the "love" chapter of 1 Corinthians in insisting that, as Juan says
elsewhere, "a single work or act of the will done in charity is more precious
before God than all the visions and revelations and communications from heaven
that there can be." 
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 2, ch. 22, p. 306: 
"[...] es más preciosa delante de Dios una obra o acto de voluntad hecho en
caridad que cantas visiones y revelaciones y comunicaciones pueden tener del
cielo."]

The contrast between this passage and the quotation from Kircher shows that
Catholics were not all of one mind about sensation and faith.
The difference between these two descriptions of music's power reflects 
a chronological change in Catholic attitudes between the late sixteenth and
mid seventeenth centuries, as well as a contrast between religious orders, and
differing emphases on parts of the Christian life. 
Juan's *Ascent of Mount Carmel* was first published in 1618, though it was
written some forty years earlier; his outlook reflects the hard ascetic extreme
of Catholic Reformation attitudes toward music. 
Kircher, on the other hand, writes with the confidence of the Jesuit order at
the height of its global influence, when this order was still trying to engage
with any aspect of culture that they saw as advancing their mission. 
Kircher is interested in music's power to convert---not only to persuade
catechumens of the truth but to enable them to experience truth. 
Juan, on the other hand, is concerned with the limiting effect of sonic
pleasures on the maturity of the already converted. 
Both acknowledge music's power over the individual person's senses, but they
differ in how much they trust that power to produce godly effects.
Later Catholics who shared Juan's ascetic bent, or his pastoral concern with
spiritual growth, saw that power as a danger or even an opening for diabolical
influence.
