l. 385
When the music moved in the same way as the affections it expressed, this in
turn moved the listener to feel the same affections.
[Kircher's theory bears a striking resemblance to some recent theories of music
cognition, such as Lawrence Zbikowski's description of musical structures as
"sonic analogues for internal dynamic processes"; @Zbikowski:Conceptualizing,
XX.]

l. 452
These differences of style and perception are caused by patriotism---the
inordinate love of things from one's own country, as Kircher describes it; and
by what each person is accustomed to hearing, which is shaped by the traditions
of each country.

l. 530
Regarding the problem of individual hearing, Reformation controversies had
pushed Catholics into an increasingly negative and anxious attitude toward
subjective religious experience. 
Polemicists like Thomas More accused Martin Luther of turning his followers away
from the trustworthy institutional Church with its objectively operating
sacraments, leaving them with only a subjective experience as assurance of
salvation, and separating individual faith from the cultivation of a just
society.

Faith thus means being empowered by God's grace to go beyond the senses, to
reach "the assurance of things not seen" (Heb. XX). <!--- citation -->

Some missionaries like the Jesuits in Japan and Brazil actively sought to
accommodate local customs and music; but everywhere that missionaries brought
Christian faith, the process of cultural translation inevitably transformed it
into something neither they nor their converts could necessarily predict.

As Lorenzo Candelaria has suggested, when the Council of Trent issued its
infamous decree that music should be preserved from anything "lascivious or
impure," the bishops may have been motivated more by concern with such songs in
non-European languages, not to mention other syncretic musical and ritual
practices across the globe, than by any European church music.

Likewise, given the differing techniques and styles of vocal production between
places like central Africa and south India today, the actual performance of
music in mission churches and colonial cathedrals, even plainchant and polyphony
imported directly from Europe, probably sounded quite different the practice of
European chapels.

This Corpus Christi mystery play (*auto sacramental*), was staged in 1634 to
inaugurate the Spanish monarch's new palace-retreat, the Buen Retiro.
Like most *autos* this one was performed in the context of a whole day of
liturgical and processional music, including numerous villancicos; and the drama
includes texts to be sung (though the music is now lost).
<!---  sources for Corpus Christi 1634 music, generally -->

l. 846
Literary scholars have considered Spanish Corpus Christi plays to be "dramas of
conversion" with the primary goal of teaching doctrine; 
and thus this literary and performative genre, 
which was so closely tied to devotional music, 
allows us to evaluate how auditory arts were used to propagate faith, and how
that effort served the purposes of the Spanish state.

Calderón's play for the politically significant occasion glorifies the
king---whose name *Felipe* cannot be said without saying *Fe* (faith)---as the
defender of the Catholic faith, which centers on the doctrine of the Eucharist.
[@Calderon:Retiro, ll. XXX]

l. 906
What would it mean, then, for hearing to be the favored sense of faith not just
because of its humility, but because of its actual weakness? 
Dominique Reyre interprets the play as a straightforward medium for
"transmission of dogma," and Margaret Greer analyzes it anthropologically as a
ritual that reinforced the king's power; but neither scholar accounts
sufficiently for the high degree of uncertainty expressed on stage.
[@Reyre:Retiro; @Greer:Retiro]

return to "drama of conversion" concept -->
How could an auditory art form like sacred drama, or the villancicos that
were usually performed in conjunction with them, provide a medium for
propagating faith or instituting social discipline, if hearing was so easily
deceived?

l. 988
The musical ritual of the seventeenth-century Church involved a large number of
community participants, for whom performing music with the body and hearing it
were inextricably linked. 
The musical efforts of the colonizing church concretely built social
relationships through musical training.
<!--- [@RamosKittrell] -->

l. 994
For this reason, we cannot fully understand the faith of early modern Catholics
on the basis of verbal formulations alone; we need to see and hear how
communities practiced their faith through coordinated action---such as in
devotional music.[^cf-Cruger]

[^cf-Cruger]: 
The Lutheran hymn composer Johann Crüger advocated a similar concept of "the
musical practice of piety" (*Praxis pietatis melica*, 1647 and many later
editions), coming out of the Lutheran "new piety" movement of the seventeenth
century, whose proponents (Martin Moller, Johann Arndt) were inspired by much of
the same medieval devotional literature as their Catholic counterparts.

The poem invites hearers to imagine the senses "filing a complaint"

Battle pieces typically feature a slow, peaceful introduction followed by
sections in contrasting meters and styles and a texture of dialogue between
opposing groups (as in between high and low registers on the keyboard). 
Typical of the style is the reiteration of 5/3 ("root position") chord voicings,
with the bass moving by fourths and fifths, and the 3--3--2 syncopations on *no
se den por sentidos los sentidos* as in mm. 31--33.

Carrión was capable of the festival style, as in his *Qué destemplada armonía*
(E-SE: 20/5), which almost takes on the dimensions of a *cantada*.
But this setting fits more in the subgenre of *tono divino* or chamber
villancico, a continuo song used in more intimate settings like Eucharistic
devotion. 
[See, for example, @Robledo:MadridTonos.]

The treatment of the senses in these villancicos reflects a common physiological
model of sensation and perception, as educated Spaniards would have learned from

All of these exterior and interior senses were part of the *ánima sensitiva*,
the sensing, reasoning soul. 
In addition to these senses the *ánima sensitiva* possessed an affective
faculty, in which the balance of humors in the body interacted with the interior
and exterior senses to produce different "passions" or "affects" (Fray Luis uses
*pasiones* and *afectos* interchangeably). 
Based on a fundamental dichotomy like magnetism between attraction and
repulsion, this "concupiscible" part of the soul experienced three primary pairs
of passions: love and hate, desire and fear, joy and sadness.

Galán was master of the Royal Chapel from 1680 to 1684, and to judge from
copies of his works in multiple archives, his works were performed all across
the empire and likely served as models for provincial composers who wanted to
stay current with trends in Madrid.
He had actually preceded Irízar as chapelmaster at Segovia Cathedral in XXX

They return to white notation again for the following phrase, "while the voice
is seen in purity." 
Any attentive listener could hear these juxtapositions and abrupt shifts in
rhythmic patterns, though only the musicians themselves would likely have
recognized the dark--light symbolism in the notation.

Padilla sets the final phrase about deaf men with ten blackened notes in mensural
coloration.
Where Galán used musical coloration as a symbol of blindness, here Padilla would
seem to use the same symbol to point to a deficit in hearing.
This phrase make a rhetorical *catabasis* as it descends in a leaping melodic
sequence.

When the rest of Chorus I joins in for the responsión, their repeated dotted
rhythm suggests vivacious laughter and comic offbeat sobs on *sollozos*
((ref float 'music 'Padilla-Sordo-responsion)). 
The catabasis figure is passed through all the voices in imitation, leading to a
harmonic catabasis when the Tiple I adds E flat---shifting further away from the
"natural" into the "weak" realm of flats.

The last example, the *Villancico de los sordos* by Matías Ruiz (E-E: Mús.

catechist as well

The poetry imprint survives from the first performance by the Royal Chapel at
Madrid's Convent of the Incarnation in 1671, where Ruiz was chapelmaster.

In the parodied catechism lesson presented in the coplas, the friar quizzes his
pupil on the same key doctrines of Christmas emphasized by contemporary
theological writers both scholastic and pastoral.[^Christmas-tropes] 
Tell, *sordo*, he asks, how did God fulfill his word to the
prophet-king David?
What motivated Christ to become incarnate?
But the deaf man mishears every statement: he mistakes *sordo* for *gordo*
(chubby), and hears *profeta* (prophet) as *estafeta* (mailman).

preaching in villancicos.

The deaf man even explicitly asks not to be mocked:
since he cannot hear the nine choirs of Christmas angels, he asks them to "sing out

Indeed, this villancico features a distinctive harmonic and rhythmic pattern
with alternating ternary and sesquialtera groupings, which are most clear on the
phrase *los que no escuchan ni entienden el son*
((ref float 'music 'Ruiz-Sordos-son)).
This pattern bears a close resemblance to dance forms known as *son* today
---most obviously, the Mexican *huarache* familiar from the song "America" in
Leonard Bernstein's *West Side Story*.

Where did this theology of hearing leave actual people with hearing
disabilities?
At the same time as these caricatures of the deaf were performed, the Spanish
churchman Juan Pablo Bonet was laying the foundations of modern deaf education.

Whether these pieces accomplished anything more than amusing hearers by
reinforcing their prejudices is a question that haunts the whole repertoire of
Spanish devotional music---and one that should give modern performers pause
before reviving some villancicos.
[@Cashner:WLSCM32, XXX]

l. 1809
After all, the friars are caricatured just as much as the deaf men are.
Padilla's piece was performed at the epicenter of religious reform in the New
World, and Ruíz's piece was heard by the royal defender of the faith Charles II.
