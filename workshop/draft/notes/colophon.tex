\section*{Colophon}

This book was originally prepared in the Vim text editor for the \LaTeX{}
document-preparation system, based on the work of Donald Knuth and Leslie
Lamport.
The maps, diagrams, tables, and poem examples were all produced with \LaTeX{},
using the packages \term{pst-geo}, \term{tikz}, and \term{reledmac}.
The musical examples were typeset with Lilypond, version 2.19, originally
developed by Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen.
I am grateful to the many volunteers who help maintain and support this
free software.
