        As a cantor in Puebla Cathedral was intoning a Latin sermon of Pope St.
        Leo the Great—the first reading in the second Nocturne of Matins—the
        musical chapel was preparing to raise their own voices.
        Holding handwritten notebooks with their individual performing parts for
        this year's new cycle of villancicos, they looked to Father Padilla for
        their cue.
        When the chanting concluded with a descending cadence, Padilla made sure the
        chorus had the right starting pitches in their ears: he may have sung an
        intonation, or had someone play a chord or short improvised cadence on the
        organ.[@Cashner:WLSCM32]
        He raised his hand and indicated the downbeat, the start of the metrical
        <em>compás</em> or measure, and on one side of the double-choir
        ensemble, the three voice parts (possibly three individual singers) of
        Chorus I entered on the second beat, singing the word <em>Voces</em>.
        The boy <em>tiple</em> or treble, adolescent alto, and tenor all sang
        this word high in their registers, and the soft (<em>mollis</em>, weak,
        minor) harmony of the opening G chord hung mysteriously in the vaulted
        space between the columns of the new cathedral's architectural choir.
        Moving in the same rhythm, following the natural accents of the poetry,
        the voices declaimed these words like a solemn choral recitative (music
        example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-opening`).

        <blockquote>
            <p>
            Voices of the chapel choir,<br />
            keep count with what is sung,<br />
            for the King is a musician,<br />
            and takes note of even the most venial dissonances,<br />
            after the manner of David the monarch,<br />
            just as in the manner of Jesus the infant prince.
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        The other choir remained silent for these lines, their notated parts
        instructing them to heed the other chorus's admonition to "keep count"
        of twenty-seven measures of rests until their entrance.
