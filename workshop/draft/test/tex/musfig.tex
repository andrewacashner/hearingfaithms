Battle pieces typically feature a slow, peaceful introduction followed by
sections in contrasting meters and styles and a texture of dialogue between
opposing groups (as in between high and low registers on the keyboard).
Typical of the style is the reiteration of \musFig{5 3}
(``root position'') chord voicings, with the bass moving by fourths and
fifths, and the syncopated 3--3--2 groupings of corcheas (eighth notes) on
\emph{no se den por sentidos los sentidos} as in mm.~31--33.
