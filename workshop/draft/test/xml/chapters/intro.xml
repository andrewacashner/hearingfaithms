  <p>
    St. Paul taught that faith came by means of hearing, and one of
the distinctive effects of the sixteenth-century reformations of
Western Christianity was that Christians discovered new ways to make
their faith audible.
Voices raised in acrid contention or pious devotion boomed from
pulpits, clamored in public squares, and were echoed in homes and
schools.
In new forms of vernacular music, the voices of the newly distinct
communities united to articulate their own vision of Christian faith.
Catholic reformers and missionaries enlisted music in their campaigns
to educate, evangelize, and build Christian civilization, both in an
increasingly divided Europe and in the new domains of the Spanish
crown across the globe.
In these efforts to make <q>the word of Christ</q> to be heard and
believed, then, what was the role of music?
What kind of power did Catholics believe music had over the dynamics
of hearing and faith?
  </p>
  <p>
    This book is a study of how Christians in early modern
Spain and Spanish America enacted religious beliefs about music
through the medium of music itself.
It focuses on villancicos, a widespread genre of devotional poetry and
musical performance, for two primary reasons.
First, these pieces were actively employed by the Spanish church and
state as tools for propagating faith.
By the seventeenth century villancicos had grown in to a complex,
large-scale form of vocal and instrumental music based on poetic texts
in the vernacular, and they were performed in and around liturgical
celebrations on all the major feast days, across the Spanish world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In their poetic themes and in their musical content,
villancicos combined elements of elite and common culture.
In subject matter as well as in the places and
occasions of their performance, villancicos stood on the threshold
between the world in and outside of church (which is not quite the
same as a modern divide between sacred and secular).
Sets of villancicos featured dramatic, often comic texts reminiscent
of Spanish minor theater (<term>teatro menor</term>) alongside
cultivated and even arcanely sophisticated theological reflections.
The music for villancicos covered a wide stylistic range from
old-style polyphonic techniques to highly rhythmic music drawing on
dance traditions.
  </p>
 

   <p>
     Villancicos are valuable, then, for assessing the interaction
of these distinctive elements that meet within the genre.
Were villancicos a form of top-down <soCalled>propaganda</soCalled>
intended to indoctrinate and control, as some have claimed of
post-Tridentine religious arts?
Or were they a grassroots expression of popular devotion?
Did they work on multiple levels, even contradictory ones?
   </p>
 <p>
    The boundary-crossing nature of villancicos is
expressed vividly in one of the more commonly performed villancicos
from colonial Mexico, a piece set by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for
Puebla Cathedral in 1653 (discussed further in chapter 7).
Here the singers describe their own music-making as serving up
<q>village feed</q> to a refined courtly table.

   <p>
     The second reason for focusing on villancicos is that a
large portion of the repertoire explicitly addresses theological
beliefs about music.
The Spanish poetry of seventeenth-century villancicos frequently
treats musical topics, sometimes using ingenious conceits that create
rich and nuances links between musical and theological ideas.
The musical settings turn a poetic discourse about music into a
musical discourse about music.
   </p>
   <p>
     Of all the musical forms of Catholic Spain, then, sacred
villancicos address the theological nature and function of music most
frequently and directly.
Among the hundreds of surviving musical manuscripts and the even
larger quantity of printed poetry leaflets, a great many pieces begin
with direct invocations of the sense of hearing, exhorting hearers to
<q>hear</q>, <q>listen</q>, and <q>pay attention</q>
(<mentioned>oíd</mentioned>, <mentioned>escuchad</mentioned>,
<mentioned>atended</mentioned>).
Villancico poets and composers favored themes of singing and dancing,
as in Christmas sets, for example, they represented the angelic choirs
of Christmas, singing and dancing shepherds, Magi, and even animals in
the Nativity stable.
   </p>
   <p>
     There are also representations of instrumental performance and
characteristic dances of different ethnic groups (such as African
slaves and <soCalled>gypsies</soCalled>).
Early example of villancicos about singing include <title>Gil pues a
cantar</title> from Pedro Ruimonte’s <title>Parnoso español</title>
(Antwerp, 1614) and <title>Sobre bro canto llano</title> by Gaspar
Fernández (Puebla, 1610).<!--

A few <soCalled>black</soCalled> villancicos or
<term>negrillas</term>, which represent dark-skinned people dancing
and playing instruments in what is supposed to be their characteristic
style, have become well known, such as <title>A siolo
Flasiquiyo</title> by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (Puebla, 1653) and
<title>Los coflades de la estleya</title> by Juan de Araujo (Sucre,
ca. 1700).<!--

   </p>
   <p>
     These pieces constitute <soCalled>music about music</soCalled>.
If a play within a play in Spanish Golden Age drama may be termed
metatheatrical, then these pieces are
<soCalled>metamusical</soCalled>.
   </p>
   <p>
     Understanding the theology of music articulated in
villancicos can illuminate why and how villancicos were used to
propagate faith.
Doing so will deepen our knowledge of how music general fit into the
religious worldview of early modern Catholics.
For Catholic believers in the Spanish Empire of the seventeenth
century, what kind of power did music have to affect the relationship
between faith and the sense of hearing?
If music had supernatural power, how was that power linked to the
worldly powers of church and state?
By engaging interpretively with these villancicos we may gain a better
understanding of how early modern Catholics used music for spiritual
ends, and how the spiritual intersected with the wordly functions of
this music within Spanish society.
   </p>
   <p>
     This book is the first large-scale attempt to understand
the theological aspect of seventeenth-century villancicos across the
Hispanic world.
It is also one of only a few studies to analyze villancicos musically
in detail.
Most importantly, the primary goal of the project is to combine these
two modes of analysis, to understand how theological beliefs were
expressed and shaped through the details of musical composition and
performance.
   </p>
   <p>
     The goal is to understand the <term>musical
theology</term> of villancicos.
This term does not mean just a verbal formulation of theological ideas
about music by historical figures, and it certainly does not connote a
normative theological interpretation from a modern scholar’s own
personal perspective.
<!-- TODO more on insider/outsider problem, with citations -->
Instead, we may conceive of this historical form of devotional
performance as a communal act in which religious ideas and values were
performed (put into practice) through musical structures.
To understand the theological content, we must understand the musical
practices; and to make sense of the music, we must seek to hear it as
a form of theological expression.

       To begin, then, we must consider what metamusical villancicos
are and what they reveal about seventeenth-century theological
concepts of music.

       Music about Music in the Villancico Genre
     </head>
    
     <p>
       The villancicos studied in this book refer in some way to
music.
Some focus on making music; others on hearing it.
As such, these pieces constitute music that refers to itself.
     </p>
     <p>
       If we say that a villancico is <q>music about music</q>,
the two instances of <mentioned>music</mentioned> in this label have
multiple meanings.
The first <mentioned>music</mentioned> refers to a specific villancico
as a musical entity, which includes the performance instructions
encoded in notation, the music as it sounds when performed
(generalizing from various possible interpretations and guessing about
elements of performance not recorded in notation), and also the piece
as it existed in history, such as its first known performance in a
particular place.
By the second term <mentioned>music</mentioned> we
may mean several things depending on the piece in question: it could
mean other sounding music (the <term>musica instrumentalis</term> of
Boethius) that the villancico imitates or to which the piece alludes,
quotes, or pays homage, as in musical topics and tropes.
It could also mean music as an abstract concept, which can hve
increasing levels of abstractions along a Neoplatonic chain ascending
to the <soCalled>Music</soCalled> of the Triune Godhead itself.
The essential point is that metamusical villancicos create a link
between two kinds or levels of music: the music performed and heard
points beyond itself to other kinds of music, human or celestial.
     </p>
     <p>
       A global survey of villancico poems and music reveals
nine main categories of metamusical villancicos.
This non-exhaustive survey was drawn from archival musical and poetic
sources and form listings in catalogs and published studies (see the
bibliography under <q>Primary Sources</q>), covering a global range of
sources.
The survey found more than nine hundred extant, cataloged villancicos
that reference metamusical themes, a number that only hints at the
original size of this repertoire.
Table <ptr type="doc"
target="#table:survey-metamusical-topics"/> lists the most common
topics in order of frequency.
We will consider select examples of pieces in each category, beginning
with two exemplary villancicos in which several of these topics are
found together.
