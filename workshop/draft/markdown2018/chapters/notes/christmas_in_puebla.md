On Christmas Eve 1657 in Puebla de los Ángeles, the sun had long since passed
below the crests of the two volcanos, Iztaccihuatl and Popocatépetl, but the
children of the colonial city were still awake when the cathedral bells began to
chime at 10 p.m.
During the next hour the bells continued to chime while Spaniard and *criollo*
mothers worked to get their children out the door and through the darkened
streets to the cathedral.
Along the way common families were passed by the retinues of landowners and
mercantilists with their male and female African slaves. 
When they reached the plaza they pushed past crowds of indigenous and mixed-race
people, many of them enjoying a holiday from their labors in the textile mills.

Entering the cathedral it took their eyes a few minutes to adjust to the bright
light of the candles and luminaries that were set up all throughout the space.
The light glowed in reflection from the white walls and columns and gleamed from
the gold and brass furniture.

The clerics of the cathedral chapter in their black robes
had been there early and had now arranged themselves in a semicircle between the
walls of the choir, with the open end facing the altar.
They gathered around the large four-sided *facistol* or lectern which held the
books of chant.
Joining them was the rest of the cathedral's musical chapel, including some
dozen boys and adolescents, some with hand-me-down robes a size too big for this
year; others straining to loosen the collars around their growing Adam's apples.
The boys and men held paper music notebooks with handwritten performing parts
for the year's villancicos.
An ensemble of instrumentalists had set themselves up there as well: the
organist had just about finished tuning a pipe on his small organ that had not
adjusted well to the cool evening breezes; jutting up beside him was a
cross-strung harp and a small forest of *bajones* and
*bajoncillos*---bassoon-like reed instruments of every size. 

The families found their place next to one of the side-altars, where they could
see a portion of the musical ensemble and some of the altar.
Everyone could see above them Mary on the altar retable, whose virgin motherhood
as a poor traveller they had come to celebrate.
The worshippers lifted their eyes to marvel at the sympathetic image of the
Blessed Virgin on the still-new high-altar retable, surrounded by angels
dancing, singing, and playing instruments, all in vivid blue and gold tones of
the retable above the high altar.  
On either side of the altar they could see painted the friendly sights of the
shepherds, humble like them, adoring the baby Jesus; and the 
mysterious kings from exotic lands leading a multitude to visit the manger and
leaving their gifts.
Slaves and freed blacks from Angola could recognize themselves in image of the
black Magus, his skin as dark as theirs, and his carriage as noble as the Congo
kings from whom they traced their own lineage, a memory they were keeping alive
through the Black Kings festival the black confraternities were planning for
twelve days later.

The service was already running late, to judge by the worried expression on the
sacristan's face.
The choir had already sung several psalms, motets, and villancicos while priests
made their ritual gestures and chanted their prayers and readings.
Few of the people present could understand the words that were chanted, though a
few phrases sounded familiar to those who had come year after year.
They were there out of obligation---to visit the Christ-child in his manger, to
see Christ made present in the Eucharist (though of course they would not dare
to partake themselves), but above all to hear the new set of villancicos that
the chapel would present.

The seminary teachers had already gotten their hands on the printed leaflet of
villancico poems that would be sung that night, and some of them noted with
pride that some of these texts had been sung in the Royal Chapel or the
Mother Church in Seville only a year or two earlier, and with even greater pride
that some of the texts were entirely new.
They had already identified the different subgenres that were being presented
and each looked forwarding to hearing his favorite kind; some had even spent
some time puzzling over the more complicated poems with their students and
laughing at the silly antics of those recurring characters Gil, Pascual, and
Bartholo.
Last year's feast had been a marvelous display of poetic ingenuity and musical
creativity; how would the chapter top that this year?
