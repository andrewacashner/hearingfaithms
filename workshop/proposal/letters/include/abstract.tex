Enclosed please find the prospectus and sample excerpt for my monograph,
\wtitle{Hearing Faith: Music as Theology in the Spanish Empire}.
The book asks how early modern Catholics on both sides of the Atlantic
understood music's role in the relationship between faith and hearing.
The study focuses on complex pieces of devotional music with vernacular texts
(\term{villancicos}), which explicitly raise topics of faith, hearing, and the
power of music.
By analyzing and interpreting the poetry and music of these pieces in the
context of the religious and social culture of seventeenth-century Spain and New
Spain, I enable readers to understand how people expressed beliefs about music
through the medium of music itself.
The book raises questions about how the Spanish church and state used music to
communicate religious ideas and shape community, and how hearers perceived and
responded to this communication.

This is an interdisciplinary study that combines historical musicology and
musical analysis with Spanish literature, historical theology, and early modern
studies.
I am looking for a press and an editor who can help this book find the widest
audience of readers who would benefit from it.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as it may be convenient.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
Please do let me know beforehand if you would like to send these materials out
for peer review.
