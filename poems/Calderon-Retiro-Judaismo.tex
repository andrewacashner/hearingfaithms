\begin{verse}
Who are you, that I see you and I do not know it,\\
because I have listened to Faith without faith? 

\Dots\\
Are you that manna that quenched thirst\\
and satisfied hunger?\\
Are you the fruit that is dangling from the tree\\
that gave knowledge of good and evil?\\
Are you the serpent that gave us healing\\
staked to the staff of Moses?\\
For I doubt it now, even though I know it,\\
because I have listened to Faith without faith. 

But surely you must be the flower of Jericho,\\
surely you must be the lily of the valleys,\\
white manna that rained from Heaven for us,\\
pale dew that dampened the fleece,\\
dangling serpent, fire that showed the way,\\
forbidden fruit, rejected honey,\\
I cannot comprehend you nor know your enigma,\\
because I have listened to Faith without faith. 

And so, let him run to your singular goal\\
who can appraise your value,\\
for I will always doubt your being,\\
for I will never perceive your light,\\
because you are not the Host of my altar,\\
because you are not the sun of my setting,\\
because your dark cipher I did not comprehend,\\
because I have listened to Faith without faith. 

\emph{All the musical instruments play, shawms and snares, drums and trumpets,
and everyone enters crowned with wreaths, and with lances, as for battle, 
to the measure of the clarion.}
\end{verse}
