[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mGNU[24m [4mEmacs[24m is a version of [4mEmacs[24m, written by the author of the original (PDP-10) [4mEmacs[24m, Richard Stallman.  The user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses everything other editors
       do, and it is easily extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

       The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs Manual, which you can read using Info, either from Emacs or as a standalone program.  Please look  there  for  complete
       and up-to-date documentation.  This man page is updated only when someone volunteers to do so.

       [4mEmacs[24m  has  an  extensive  interactive  help facility, but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate [4mEmacs[24m windows and buffers.  CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility.
       Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) starts an interactive tutorial to quickly teach beginners the fundamentals of [4mEmacs.[24m  Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a command with a name match‚Äê
       ing a given pattern, Help Key (CTRL-h k) describes a given key sequence, and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp function.

       [4mGNU[24m  [4mEmacs[24m's many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile), running subshells within [4mEmacs[24m windows (Shell),
       running a Lisp read-eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy (Doctor), and much more.

   [1mEmacs Options[0m
       The following options are of general interest:

              [4mfile[24m    Edit [4mfile[24m.

              [1m-L [4m[22mdir[24m, [1m--directory [4m[22mdir[0m
                      Add [4mdir[24m to the list of directories [4mEmacs[24m searches for Lisp files.

   [1mUsing Emacs with X[0m
       [4mEmacs[24m  has  been tailored to work well with the X window system.  If you run [4mEmacs[24m from under X windows, it will create its own X window to display in.  You will probably want to
       start the editor as a background process so that you can continue using your original window.

       [4mEmacs[24m can be started with the following X switches:

              [1m--name [4m[22mname[0m
                      Specify the name which should be assigned to the initial [4mEmacs[24m window.  This controls looking up X resources as well as the window title.

              [1m-T [4m[22mname[24m, [1m--title [4m[22mname[0m
                      Specify the title for the initial X window.

              [1m-r[22m, [1m-rv[22m, [1m--reverse-video[0m
                      Display the [4mEmacs[24m window in reverse video.

              [1m-fn [4m[22mfont[24m, [1m--font [4m[22mfont[0m
                      Set the [4mEmacs[24m window's font to that specified by [4mfont[24m.  You will find the various [4mX[24m fonts in the [4m/usr/lib/X11/fonts[24m directory.  Note that [4mEmacs[24m  will  only  accept
                      fixed  width  fonts.   Under  the X11 Release 4 font-naming conventions, any font with the value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the font name is a fixed width
                      font.  Furthermore, fonts whose name are of the form [4mwidth[24mx[4mheight[24m are generally fixed width, as is the font [4mfixed[24m.  See [1mxlsfonts[22m(1) for more information.

                      When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between the switch and the font name.

              [1m--xrm [4m[22mresources[0m
                      Set additional X resources.

              [1m--color[22m, [1m--color=[4m[22mmode[0m
                      Override color mode for character terminals; [4mmode[24m defaults to "auto", and can also be "never", "auto", "always", or a mode name like "ansi8".

              [1m-bw [4m[22mpixels[24m, [1m--border-width [4m[22mpixels[0m
                      Set the [4mEmacs[24m window's border width to the number of pixels specified by [4mpixels[24m.  Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.

              [1m-ib [4m[22mpixels[24m, [1m--internal-border [4m[22mpixels[0m
                      Set the window's internal border width to the number of pixels specified by [4mpixels[24m.  Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the window.

              [1m-g [4m[22mgeometry[24m, [1m--geometry [4m[22mgeometry[0m
                      Set the [4mEmacs[24m window's width, height, and position as specified.  The geometry specification is in the standard X format; see [1mX[22m(7) for more information.  The width
                      and height are specified in characters; the default is 80 by 24.  See the Emacs manual, section "Options for Window Size and Position", for information on how win‚Äê
                      dow sizes interact with selecting or deselecting the tool bar and menu bar.

              [1m-D[22m, [1m--basic-display[0m
                      This option disables many display features; use it for debugging Emacs.

       You can set [4mX[24m default values for your [4mEmacs[24m windows in your [4m.Xresources[24m file (see [1mxrdb[22m(1)).  Use the following format:

              emacs.[4mkeyword[24m:[4mvalue[0m

       where [4mvalue[24m specifies the default value of [4mkeyword[24m.  [4mEmacs[24m lets you set default values for the following keywords:

[1mMANUALS[0m
       You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs Manual from the Free Software Foundation, which develops GNU software.  See the online store at <http://shop.fsf.org/>.
       Your  local administrator might also have copies available.  As with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is permitted to make and distribute copies of the Emacs man‚Äê
       ual.  The Texinfo source to the manual is also included in the Emacs source distribution.

[1mFILES[0m
       /usr/local/share/info ‚Äî files for the Info documentation browser.  The complete text of the Emacs reference manual is  included  in  a  convenient  tree  structured  form.   Also
       includes the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, useful to anyone wishing to write programs in the Emacs Lisp extension language, and the Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp ‚Äî Lisp source files and compiled files that define most editing commands.  Some are preloaded; others are autoloaded from this directory when
       used.

       /usr/local/libexec/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCH ‚Äî various programs that are used with GNU Emacs.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc ‚Äî various files of information.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* ‚Äî contains the documentation strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded Lisp functions of GNU Emacs.  They are stored here to  reduce
       the size of Emacs proper.

[1mBUGS[0m
       There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org, for reporting Emacs bugs and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is a bug, not a
       misunderstanding or a deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section "Reporting Bugs" in the Emacs manual for hints on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include  the  ver‚Äê
       sion  number  of the Emacs you are running in [4mevery[24m bug report that you send in.  Bugs tend actually to be fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report them
       in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.

       Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release, if possible.  For personal assistance, con‚Äê
       sult the service directory at <http://www.fsf.org/resources/service/> for a list of people who offer it.

       Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list.  For other Emacs lists, see <http://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=emacs>.
