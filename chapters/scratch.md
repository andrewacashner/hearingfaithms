<!--- ch2 , on Kircher -->
This passage in Kircher's Book VII comes in the midst of a comparison between
the fabled powers of music in the ancient world versus the possibilities for
moving the affections in contemporary music. 
For Kircher, modern music was superior to ancient music not because it operated
according to different principles, but because modern musicians had found ways
to extend and amplify the same principles that made ancient music effective. 
Just as Plato says the Greek modes incited different reactions in hearers,
Kircher assumes that the various modes and styles of modern music have inherent
affective properties: the Dorian mode, for example, is suited to grave and pious
religious sentiment. 

<!--- on danger of subjective experience -->
This theology of faith begins with God's grace opening the mind of the passive
person, but ends with an act of the individual will. 

the creator is above all created things that can be perceived through the
senses, and that therefore humans cannot come to the knowledge of God without
the gift of God's grace.  

<!--- on intercultural encounter -->
Catholics since the early age of exploration had struggled to determine which
parts of Christian religion they could adapt to other cultures.
