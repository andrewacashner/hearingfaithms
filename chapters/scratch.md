<!--- ch2 , on Kircher -->
This passage in Kircher's Book VII comes in the midst of a comparison between
the fabled powers of music in the ancient world versus the possibilities for
moving the affections in contemporary music. 
For Kircher, modern music was superior to ancient music not because it operated
according to different principles, but because modern musicians had found ways
to extend and amplify the same principles that made ancient music effective. 
Just as Plato says the Greek modes incited different reactions in hearers,
Kircher assumes that the various modes and styles of modern music have inherent
affective properties: the Dorian mode, for example, is suited to grave and pious
religious sentiment. 

<!--- on danger of subjective experience -->
This theology of faith begins with God's grace opening the mind of the passive
person, but ends with an act of the individual will. 

the creator is above all created things that can be perceived through the
senses, and that therefore humans cannot come to the knowledge of God without
the gift of God's grace.  

<!--- on intercultural encounter -->
Catholics since the early age of exploration had struggled to determine which
parts of Christian religion they could adapt to other cultures. 

<!--- on hearing the word in community -->

In an ideal Catholic scenario, musical training also disciplined the whole
community as participants through performance or listening. 
In missionary and colonial contexts, this training required the community to
change its expectations of music to fit European norms. 
Music could be a way to make faith pleasing to the ear, as Kircher describes,
but this only worked if the ear was trained to find such music pleasing, as the
Japanese "ambassadors" learned to do.

In terms of the most influential medieval music theorist Boethius (*De musica*),
whose concept of music was foundational to the major Spanish music treatises
like that of Pedro Cerone, well-tuned *musica instrumentalis* (sounding, played
music) could harmonize the *musica humana*---the harmony of the individual in
body and soul, reason and passion, but also the concord of human society.
harmonies of the triune God. 



<!--- on the public sphere of villancicos -->
Villancicos manifest many of these same theological preoccupations and
anxieties. They do not answer the questions we have raised---in fact some of
them intensify the problems; but they do provide evidence for a broad public
discourse about sensation and faith even as these pieces of music were
themselves objects to be sensed and believed. 

Like most of the other sources discussed in this chapter, villancicos were
created by members of the literate elite, and thus they represent first of all a
discourse between those elite poets, musicians, and churchmen. At the same time,
though, villancicos were generally performed in public festivities with varied
audiences. Compared with the royal pomp and verbal virtuosity of Calder√≥n's
Corpus Christi drama, for example, villancicos were performed in settings where
there could be more proximity between people of different social strata. 

The same question should be asked of Italian opera, German sacred concertos, and
English anthems of the same period. 
There are not, at present, sufficient sources to reconstruct the sociology of
villancico audiences for all their varied performance contexts around the world. 

And even if we may not know exactly who listened to villancicos, the musical
sources do tell us what they heard with a far greater degree of specificity than
is possible for literature alone.
