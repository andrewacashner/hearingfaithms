\chapter{Acknowledgments}
\label{ch:thanks}

I wish to express my gratitude to the many people and institutions who have
made this book possible.
This research, which began with my PhD dissertation at the University of
Chicago, was funded by a Jacob K. Javits Fellowship from the United States
Department of Education, a Pre-Dissertation Research Fellowship from the
Center for European Studies at Columbia University, and a Dissertation
Completion Fellowship from the Mellon Foundation and the American Council of
Learned Societies.
Travel for archival research in Mexico and Spain was funded by grants from the
Center for Latin American Studies and the Department of Music at the
University of Chicago, and a Eugene K. Wolf Research Travel Grant from the
American Musicological Society.
Support for the final stages of publication was provided by an internal
fellowship from the Humanities Center at the University of Rochester.

Personal thanks are due to Gustavo Mauleón Rodríguez for getting me in the
door of the Puebla archives and for sharing select sources from a private
collection in Puebla.
For hospitality, I thank Alfredo Amieva (Mexico City), Emilio Ros-Fabregas,
and María Gembero-Ustárroz, and Tess Knighton (Barcelona).

For help and support throughout the project, I thank above all Robert Kendrick,

Mary Frandsen guided me into the field and has continued to provide
level-headed support.

Robertson, Martha Feldman, Frederick de Armas, María Gembero Ustárroz.
Thanks also to my colleagues in the University of Rochester College Music

I am grateful to the many volunteers who created and maintain the free

document-preparation system (based on the work of Donald Knuth and Leslie
Lamport), and the Lilypond music-notation system used to create all the music
examples.

Though many teachers of music deserve thanks here I must single out Charles
Combopiano and Ralph Burkhart.
I thank David Schneider and the late Rusty Hollingsworth for teaching me
Spanish in high school, and Norma Veramallay and Mary Ann Thompson for
teaching me to write.
Derek Katz provided an inspiring first exposure to musicology.

Church of La Crescenta, CA; and New Hope Free Methodist Church of Rochester,

and Nancy Miller, Robert and Sarah Miller, Mary Walquist, Betty Walquist,
and Robert Walquist of cherished memory.

A special word of gratitude is due to Devin Burke, whom I met on the first day
of college in September 2019, and has been an unflagging source of
encouragement, humor, and insight across two decades---no matter how
burdensome the burden.

This book is dedicated with love to my wife Ann, whose love makes this all
worthwhile.
All glory is due only to God the Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, through whose
Spirit I have found new mercies every morning.
