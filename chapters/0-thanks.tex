\chapter{Acknowledgments}
\label{ch:thanks}

I wish to express my gratitude to the many people and institutions who have
helped me over the last ten years.
This research began with my PhD dissertation at the University of Chicago,
funded by a Jacob K. Javits Fellowship from the United States Department of
Education, a Pre-Dissertation Research Fellowship from the Center for European
Studies at Columbia University, and a Dissertation Completion Fellowship from
the Mellon Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies.
My archival research in Mexico and Spain was funded by grants from the Center
for Latin American Studies and the Department of Music at the University of
Chicago, and a Eugene K. Wolf Research Travel Grant from the American
Musicological Society.
Support for the final stage of publication was provided by a fellowship from
the University of Rochester Humanities Center.

A special word of gratitude is due to my friend and fellow musicologist Devin
Burke, who from our meeting on the first day of college in September 1999 has
been an unflagging source of encouragement, humor, and insight across two
decades, for helping me shoulder so many burdens.

This book is dedicated with love to my wife Ann, whose love makes this all
worthwhile, and to our children Ben and Joy.
All glory is due only to God the Father of my Savior Jesus Christ, through
whose Spirit I have found new mercies every morning.
