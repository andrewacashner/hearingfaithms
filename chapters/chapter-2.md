# Making Faith Appeal to Hearing

> | I cannot comprehend you nor know your enigma,
> | because I have listened to Faith without faith.
> | --- "Judaism," in Calderón, *El nuevo palacio del Retiro*

St. Paul wrote to the Christian community in Rome, "How are they to believe if
they have not heard?" since "faith comes through hearing, and hearing, by the
Word of Christ" (Rom. 10:16--17). Sixteen centuries later, amid the ongoing
reformations of the Western Church, Catholic Christians were seeking ever new
ways to make faith audible. Poets and composers of the Spanish Empire expanded a
genre of sung poetry in the vernacular---the villancico---into large-scale
choral and instrumental performances that could appeal to the ears of elite and
common people alike.
[The major studies of the villancico as a musical and poetic genre are, in

With the Church's active patronage, villancicos became a central activity in
religious festivals throughout the year, particularly at Christmas, Corpus
Christi, and the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Church ensembles performed these
pieces, with their motet-like refrains or *estribillos* surrounding a set of
strophic verses or *coplas*, as an integral part of Matins and other liturgies.
Festival crowds from Madrid to Manila also heard villancicos in public
processions and in conjunction with mystery plays. Villancicos expressed
widespread beliefs and attitudes while also shaping them.

A large number of villancicos begin with calls to listen---*escuchad*,
*atended*, *silencio*, *atención*. Because so many villancicos explicitly address
concepts of music, sensation, and faith, these remarkable but understudied
pieces offer us unique insights into how early modern Catholics understood the
supernatural power of music. How, then, did the people who created, performed,
and listened to villancicos understand music's role in the relationship between
hearing and faith?

This chapter explores the theological climate in which villancicos were created
and heard, considering theological literature on faith and hearing, and
villancicos that treat these themes explicitly. I argue that villancicos
provided a way for church leaders to make faith appeal to the hearing of a broad
range of listeners, while also creating opportunities for listeners to consider
the nature of hearing itself. Villancicos thus fulfilled one of the central
prerogatives of the Catholic teaching after Trent, to accommodate the sense of
hearing even while training it. 

At the same time, I argue, villancicos manifest certain widespread anxieties
about the role of sensory experience in faith. Spaniards and their colonial
subjects worried about how to listen faithfully, about the role of subjective
experience and cultural conditioning, and about the possibility that some
listeners might lack the capacity to hear music rightly. Understanding
villancicos in their theological context, and interpreting villancicos as
theological sources in themselves, reveals varied and sometimes conflicting
beliefs about faith and hearing. The discourse on faith and hearing in
devotional poetry and music often raises as many questions as it answers; but
this tension, I argue, is actually central to its ability to both accommodate
the senses and train them. 

We will begin by discussing theological and literary sources that reveal
tensions in theological formulations of faith, hearing, and music. Then we will
look at a group of related villancicos, never previously edited or studied, that
manifest the same tensions. The first two pieces stage allegorical contests of
the senses in which hearing is the favored sense of faith; other pieces
deliberately confuse the senses to point to a higher truth that is beyond
sensation. The last two pieces are "villancicos of the deaf": they
represent characters whose impairments of hearing render them unable to
understand religious teaching. 

If we listen closely to villancicos as historical sources for theological
understanding, it becomes clear that villancicos functioned as much more than
vehicles for simplistic religious teaching or as banal, worldly entertainment.
The villancicos in this chapter appeal to the ear in order to give listeners an
opportunity to contemplate the challenges of faithful hearing. 

## Accommodating and Training the Ear

Catholic theologians of the Tridentine era emphasized the need for the Church's
teachers to make faith appeal to hearing, and the Church used devotional music
like villancicos in that endeavor. Catholic writers taught that since faith came
through hearing, as St. Paul said, ministers must accommodate their teaching
to the sense of hearing of their parishioners. They did not, though, view
hearing alone as completely trustworthy. Even if faith came through hearing, one
could not believe everything one heard; and thus Catholics emphasized not only
accommodating hearing, but training it. 

Though the Protestant reformers insisted that their teachings were a return to
true biblical orthodoxy, Catholic theologians believed that the reformers had
redefined faith completely. In contrast, Catholics continued to develop the
theology of faith they inherited from medieval writers like Thomas Aquinas, in
which faith was one of three virtues or capacities, along with hope and
charity. 
[@Schreiner:Certainty, 130--132]
Simple belief in intellectual propositions was "unformed faith" (*fides
informe*); it was essential that every Christian believe certain things, but
this was not the summit of Christian life.
The goal was that Christians would develop fully "formed faith" (*fides
formata*), which "worked through" the two higher virtues to result in what might
best be translated as "faithfulness." True faith was a conviction that
manifested itself through ethical behavior in fidelity to God's will.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, s. v. *Credo in Deum Patrem*, 15--20]

For Catholics, then, faith encompassed beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors; and it
connected individuals experience with ethical action as part of the community of
the Church. A man of faith was a man of virtue (the root of *virtus* being
*vir*), and thus faith was central to the Catholic Humanist goal of building a
virtuous society. Christian disciples had to not only "hear" the Church's
teaching and believe it (this would be unformed faith); they also had to
"listen" in the sense of obeying. 

### Hearing Christ the Word

A central document for understanding the faith of post-Reformation Catholics is
the catechism "for parish priests" commissioned by the Council of Trent and
first published in 1566.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614; @NewCatholic, s. v. *catechism*]
In responding to both the challenge of Protestantism and the underlying problems
that had allowed heresy to take root, the council's bishops sought to improve
the education of clergy and laity in matters of faith. They required priests and
bishops to preach on all Sundays and holy days.
[@NewCatholic, s. v. *Trent, Council of*]

The catechism was a model for teaching the clergy how to preach and teach---a
guide both to the content of Catholic faith and to the best ways of making the
faith heard and understood. Vernacular expositions of the catechism, like the
Spanish versions of Antonio de Azevedo, Juan Eusebio de Nieremberg, and Juan de
Palafox y Mendoza, brought this teaching down to a more colloquial level for (in
Palafox's words) "laborers and simple folk," with earthy illustrations and
paraphrases of Biblical stories.
[@Azevedo:Catecismo; @Nieremberg:PracticaCatecismo; @Palafox:Bocados]
These texts come alive when read aloud, and indeed the primary goal of this type
of literature was to prepare pastors to teach unlettered disciples through words
and voice, whether those disciples were the "Indians" of America or Asia, or the
peasants of Europe whose customs were still more pagan than
Christian.
[On Europe as a mission front after Trent, see @Kamen:EarlyModernSociety,
60--63.]

In the Roman Catechism, hearing is central to faith because the object of faith
is Christ, the Word of God, and the Church's mission is to make that Word
audible. According to the catechism's preface, God communicated his own nature
to humanity by taking on human flesh in Christ. Therefore the true Word of God
was not confined to Scripture or doctrines alone---the Word was a person, Jesus
Christ, to whom the prophetic scriptures testified and from whom the Church's
doctrine flowed.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 9: "Omnis autem doctrinæ ratio, quæ fidelibus
tradenda sit, verbo Dei continetur, quod in scripturas, traditionesque
distributum est."]
In the words of John's gospel, Jesus Christ himself was the *logos* or *verbum*
(John 1:1), the "Word made flesh." Where God had spoken through the law and the
prophets, now he had spoken through his Son (Heb. 1:1). 

The catechism builds its ecclesiology, or its theology of the church, on this
theology of the Incarnation. Christ, the incarnate Word, appointed apostles,
chief among them St. Peter, to be the custodians of the true faith. The
community of the Church, then, was the sacramental means through which people
would come to know Christ after his resurrection. 

There was thus a close link in Catholic theology between hearing the Word of the
Church's teaching, obeying that Word, and encountering Christ who was the Word.
The absolute center of the Church's teaching, according to the catechism, was
found in Christ's own words in John 17:3, "This is eternal life, that you should
know the only true God, and the one whom he sent, Jesus Christ."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 6: "Hæc est vita æterna, vt cognoscant te solùm
verum Deum, & quem misisti, Iesum Christum."]
All the Church's teachers should exert themselves to the end that 

> the faithful should know and love from the heart Jesus Christ, and him
> crucified [I Cor. 2:2]; and indeed to persuade them so that they
> believe with the faithfulness [*pietas*] of their inmost heart and with
> cultivated devotion [*religio*], that there is no other name given to people
> under heaven, through whom they can be saved [Acts 4:12], since Christ is the
> atonement for our sins [I John 2:2].
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 6: "Quamobrem in eo præcipuè Ecclesiastici doctoris
opera versabitur, vt fideles scire ex animo cupiant, Iesum Christum & hunc
crucifixum: sibíque certò persuadeant, atque intima cordis pietate, & religione
credant, aliud nomen non esse datum hominibus sub cœlo, in quo oporteat nos
saluos fieri: siquidem ipse propitiatio est pro peccatis nostris."]

Finally---contrary to Protestant teaching as Catholics understood it---since "in
this we know that we know him, if he keep his commandments" (I John 2:3),
teachers should model faithful living, "not in leisure" but "in applying
diligent effort to justice, piety, faith, charity, mercy," having been redeemed
"to do good works" (I Tim. 2:12); so that "whether one sets out to believe or
hope or do anything," the love of God should be the summit of all Christian
life.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 6--7: "At verò quia in hoc scimus, quoniam
cognouimus eum, si mandata eius obseruemus, proximum est, & cum eo, quod
diximus, maximè coniunctum, vt simul etiam ostendat vitam à fidelibus non in
otio, & desidia degendam esse, verùm oportere, [. . .] sectemúrque omni studio
iustitiam, pietatem, fidem, charitatem, mansuetudinem: dedit enim semetipsum pro
nobis, vt nos redimeret ab omni iniquitate, & mundaret sibi populum
acceptabilem, sectatorem bonorum operum [. . .]. Siue enim credendum, siue
sperandum, siue agendum aliquid proponatur, ita in eo semper charitas
Domini nostri commendari debet [. . .]."]

How, then, could the Church communicate the Word through the sense of hearing?
Drawing on St. Paul's dictum from Romans, the catechism challenges the Church's
ministers to find a way to make Christ the Word audible:

> Since, therefore, faith is conceived by means of hearing, it is apparent, how
> necessary it is for achieving eternal life to follow the works of the
> legitimate teachers and ministers of the faith. [. . .] Those who are called
> to this ministry should understand that in passing along the mysteries of
> faith and the precepts of life, *they must accommodate the teaching to the
> sense of hearing and intelligence*, so that by these [mysteries and precepts],
> *those whose senses have been trained* should be filled up by spiritual
> food.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 2, 8--9 (emphasis added): "Cvm autem fides ex auditu
concipiatur, perspicuum est, quàm necessaria semper fuerit ad æternam vitam
consequendam doctoris legitimi fidelis opera, ac ministerium [. . .] vt
videlicet intelligerent, que ad hoc ministerium vocati sunt, ita in tradendis
fidei mysteriis, ac vitæ præceptis, doctrinam ad audientium sensum, atque
intelligentiam accommodari oportere, vt cùm eorum animos, qui exercitatos sensus
habent, spirituali cibo expleuerint [. . .]."]

Pastors should consider "the age, intelligence [*ingenium*], customs, condition"
of their charges, to give milk to spiritual infants and solid food to the
maturing, to raise up a "perfect man [*virum perfectum*], after the measure of
the fullness of Christ."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 8: "Obseruanda est enim audientium ætas, ingenium,
mores, conditio [. . .]. sed cùm alij veluti modò geniti infantes sint, alij
in Christo adolescere incipiant, nonnulli verò quodammodo confirmata sint ætate,
necesse est diligenter considerare, quibus lacte, quibus solidiore cibo opus
sit, ac singulis ea doctrinæ alimenta præbere, quæ spiritum augeant, donec
occurramus omnes in vnitatem fidei, & agnitiones filij Dei, in virum perfectum,
in mensuram ætatis plenitudinis Christi."]

Thus the catechism teaches that for faith to come through hearing, both the
teacher and the listener had to be involved. This concept was echoed in the 1589
Spanish *Catechism of the Mysteries of the Faith* by Antonio de
Azevedo [@Azevedo:Catecismo]. This catechism begins with an image taken from
Pliny, which depicts a religious teacher with a pupil at his feet and a harp in
his hand. The teacher is shown, Azevedo says,

> with a musical instrument which gives pleasure to the ear, so that we should
> understand that Faith enters through the ear [*oído*], as St. Paul says, and
> that the disciple should be like a child, simple, without malice or duplicity,
> without knowing even how to respond or argue, but only how to listen and
> learn. Thus this image depicts for us elegantly, what the hearer of the Faith
> should be like.
[@Azevedo:Catecismo, f. 1b: "Para pintar los Romanos la
Fe, lo primero que hizieron templo y altar [. . .] Numa pompilio [. . .] puso vn
idolo: de forma de vn viejo cano, que tenia vna harpa en la mano, i estava
enseñando vn niño echado a sus pies. En esta figura o geroglifica esta encerrada
mucha filosofia, i aun cristiana. En el templo i ara denota, que la fe a de ser
firme i fixa, no movediça, ni flaca, que a cada ayre de novedad se mueva I
tambien que a menester maestros que la enseñen, i dicipulos que la oygan. I, que
el maestro a de ser anciano, i maduro en edad y bondad. Porque la dotrina es
grave, antigua, i de tomo i sustancia. No nueua, ni de pocos años sino antigue
dende los Apostoles, i con instrumento musico que da gusto al oido. Paraque
entendamos, que la Fe entra por el oido; como dize S. Pablo. I que el dicipulo
sea como niño, sencillo, sin malicia ni doblez, sin saber ni replicar, ni
arguir, mas de solo oir, y deprender. En lo qual nos dibuxa galanamente, qual a
de ser el oiente de la Fe."]

The teacher's task according to Azevedo, then, is not only to make the faith
heard, but to make it "appeal to the ear," just as he says music does. But such
teaching was limited by the sensory capacity of each listener, and therefore the
Roman Catechism argues that the task of listening requires the sense to be
properly trained. Thus pastors had to accommodate the ear even while training
it. 

How could the Church use music, then, in the effort to make Christ the Word
audible? The catechism's theology might suggest that music would contribute to
propagating faith because this medium could appeal in a special way to the sense
of hearing. If teaching should appeal to the ear *like* music, as Azevedo says,
then combining teaching with actual music would appeal all the more.
Villancicos, as an auditory medium based on poetry in the vernacular, would seem
like an ideal tool for accommodating the faith to Spanish-speaking listeners'
"sense and intelligence." At the same time, the challenge of training their
sense of hearing would seem to be multiplied with music, since the listeners
must learn to understand not only spoken language but musical structures as
well. In other words, music would seem to be a way of better accommodating faith
to the sense of hearing, but it also required more training to be heard in a
faithful way. 

### Experiencing Spiritual Truth through Music

This tension between accommodating the ear and training it may be seen in the
explanations of music's power by Athanasius Kircher. This Jesuit polymath's
compendium of musical knowledge, *Musurgia universalis*, was published in Rome
in 1650 and thence disseminated throughout the Hispanic world, with copies sent
to centers of colonial culture including Puebla and
Manila.
[@Findlen:Kircher; @Godwin:KircherTheater;
on the worldwide distribution of the book as far as Manila, see
@Irving:Colonial, 48--50. The book may be found in historical collections in
Madrid, Barcelona, Mexico City, and Puebla (two copies).]

Kircher discusses the power of music several times throughout his ten-part
treatise, including a detailed analysis of "whether, why, and what kind of power
music might have to move people's souls, and whether the stories are true that
were written about the miraculous effects of ancient
music."
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. 7, p. 549: "Vtrum, cur, & quomodo Musica uim habeat
ad animos hominum commouendos, & vtrum vera sint, quæ de mirificis Musicæ
Veteris effectibus scribuntur."].
Kircher's contribution to this favorite controversy of the Renaissance is to
defend the superiority of modern music on the basis of, among other factors, its
increased ability to move listeners through varieties of musical structure and
style. 

For Kircher, music added such power to words, that it could move a listener not
only to understand the subject of the words, but to physically experience their
truth. According to legend the famed *aulos* player Timotheus aroused Alexander
the Great to the furor of war through music, and Kircher says he did this by
adapting his song both to the feeling of war and to the disposition of the
king.
[Kircher is probably responding to @Galilei:Dialogo, 90, in discussing the
Classical source, Dio Chrysostom, *Orationes* 1 (*Peri Basileias*); a later
treatment of this subject is @Dryden:Alexander.]


The same music, he says, would have had a different effect on someone else; and
to illustrate this contrast, Kircher goes on to paint a remarkable picture of
how sacred music can move those who are disposed to it:

> If, on the other hand, [the musician] addressed the sort of man who was
> devoted to God and dedicated to meditation on heavenly things, and wished to
> move him in otherworldly affects and rapture of the mind, he would take up
> some notable theme expressed in words---a theme that would recall to the
> listener's memory the sweetness and mildness of heavenly things---and he would
> fittingly adapt it in the Dorian mode through cadences and intervals, then
> [the listener] would experience that what was said was actually true, those
> heavenly things that were made by harmonic sweetness, and he would suddenly be
> carried away beyond himself to that place where those joyful things are
> true.
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. 7, p. 550: "Sicuti contra, si quis Deo deuotum hominum
rerumque cœlestium, meditationi deditum in exoticos affectus raptusque mentis
commouere vellet is supra insigne aliquod verborum thema, quod rerum cælestium
dulcedinem, & suauitatem auditori in memoriam reuocaret, modulo dorio per
clausulas interuallaque aptè adaptet, & experietur quod dixi verum esse, statim
extra se factos dulcedine harmonica eò, vbi vera sunt gaudi rapi: vidi ego
nonsemel in viris ordinis nostri sanctitate illustribus huiusmodi
experimenta."]

Kircher says that the experience of Jesuit missionaries around the world
provides ample evidence of this miraculous power of music combined with
preaching. But Kircher's depiction of music's power goes well beyond the Jesuit
formula of "teaching, pleasing, and persuading."
[On the Jesuit approach to religious arts, see @Bailey:Art, 35--51.]
Music not only makes the teaching of doctrinal truth appealing and persuasive;
it actually transforms listeners through affective experience. In this
conception, music links the objective truth with subjective experience through
the unique ways that music affects the human body. Through principles of
sympathetic vibration, the humoral-affective properties of music could be
transferred from composer and performer to listeners. 

This passage in Kircher's Book VII comes in the midst of a comparison between
the fabled powers of music in the ancient world versus the possibilities for
moving the affections in contemporary music. Kircher argues that music moves a
listener's soul through sympathetic resonance that creates harmony between the
numerical proportions of the music and the humoral composition of the listener.
The various modes and styles of modern music, which Kircher catalogs in
detail, apparently have inherent affective properties: the Dorian mode, for
example, is suited to grave and pious religious sentiment. For Kircher, modern
music was superior to ancient music not because it operated according to
different principles, but because modern musicians had found ways to extend and
amplify the same principles that made ancient music effective. 

The fundamental principle that gave music its affective power was
sympathy.
[On the links between this interest in the occult powers of music and early
scientific research, see @Gouk:Sciences; @Gouk:Harmonics.]
Music created physical harmony---sympathetic vibration---between the affective
subject of the music (that is, what the music was meant to express), and the
listening subject, so that the music moved in the same way as the affections it
expressed, and this in turn moved the listener to the same affections. 

Music with different intervallic relationships, with the semitone placed
differently in different modes, produced different effects. Kircher explains:

> Since harmony is nothing other than the concord, agreement, and mutually
> corresponding proportion between dissimilar voices, this proportion, then, of
> numbers, sets the air in motion; the motion, indeed, is to be varied by the
> ratios of various intervals, ascending and descending; so that the spirits [i.
> e. , *spiritus animales*], or the implanted internal air [. . .], should be
> moved according to the proportions of the motion of the external air, so that
> the spirits' motion are effected in various ways; and through this affections
> can be engendered in the person.
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 552: "Cum harmonia nihil aliud sit, quam dissimilium vocum
concordia, consensus, & undequaque correspondens proportio; proportio autem
numerorum in motu aeris elucescat; motus verò pro varia interuallorum, ascensus,
descensusque ratione varius sit, spiritus quoque, siue aer internus implantatus,
vti paulò ante ostensum fuit, iuxta proportionem motus aeris extrinseci
moueatur, fit vt spiritus moti ope vari\c{e}, indè in homini affectiones
nascantur."]

The structure of the music's movements must correspond to the movements of the
body's humors. Kircher theorizes four conditions that are necessary for music to
achieve an effect; without any one, music will fail to move the listener in the
intended way:

> The first is harmony itself. Second, number, and proportion. Third, the power
> and efficacy of the words to be pronounced in music itself; or, the oration.
> Fourth is the disposition of the hearers, or the subject's capacity to
> remember things.
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550: "Tertius purè naturalis est, per harmonicum, scilicet
sonum, qui nisi quatuor conditiones annexas habeat, quarum vna deficiente,
desideratus effectus minimé obtinebitur: Prima est ipsa harmonia. Secunda,
numerus, & proportio. Tertia, verborum in ipsa musica prouniciandorum vis, &
efficacia, siue ipsa oratio. Quarta audientis dispositio, siue subiectum
memoratarum rerum capax."]

If there must be this kind of congruence between music and listener, then it
makes sense that Kircher acknowledges that music affects different people in
different ways. First, Kircher concedes that geographic and cultural factors
influence music style and its effect, such that Italians and Germans are moved
by different styles and therefore compose differently. These national styles, he
says, are the result of a national "genius" (that is, the special gift of that
people), as well as environmental factors, such that Germans draw a grave style
from living in a cold climate, contrasted with the more moderate style of
Italians. People of the Orient who visit Rome, Kircher says, do not enjoy the
highly delicate music of that city, and prefer their own strident, clangorous
music. These differences of style and perception are caused by patriotism---the
inordinate love of things from one's own country, as Kircher describes it; and
by what each person is accustomed to hearing, which is shaped by the traditions
of each country 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 543--544].

<!--- XXX translation in Strunk -->

Moreover, "just as different nations enjoy a different style of music, likewise
within each nation, people of different temperaments appreciate different styles
that conform the most to their natural inclinations."
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 544: "Quod quemadmodum diversæ nationes diuerso stylo musico
gaudent, ita & in vnaquaque natione diuersi temperamenti homines, diuersis
stylis, vnusquisque suæ naturali inclinationi maximè conformibus afficiuntur."]
What delights a person with a sanguine temperament might enrage or madden a
melancholic listener; what has a strong effect on one person may have no effect
at all on another [@Kircher:Musurgia, 550]. 
"Music does not just move any subject, but the one with which the natural humor
of the music is congruent [. . .] for unless the spirits of the receiving
subject correspond exactly, the music accomplishes
nothing."
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550: "Musica igitur vt moueat, non qualecunque subiectum
vult, sed illud cuius humor naturalis musicae congruit [. . .] quæ nisi
recipientis subiecti spiritui extactè respondeant, nihil efficient."]
Furthermore, Kircher suggests that not only humoral temperament but also training
and intelligence are a factor in individual listening, since he includes the
capacity of memory in his list of four conditions for effective music. 

Despite Kircher's confidence in modern musicians' ability to make music music
move people, the conditions he names may not have been as easy to fulfill as he
suggests. There must be congruence, first of all, between the structure of the
music and subject of that music: the music must move in the same way as the
affective movements it seeks to incite. Harmonic ratios, metrical proportions,
verbal rhetoric---all of these must align, but they were still not enough
without the fourth condition, the disposition of the hearer. The listener must
have a humoral temperament that is moved in the desired way by the music. 

This means that the tension between accommodating hearing and training it is
multiplied vastly by the addition of music. While it might seem that music would
allow for greater accommodation, the number of potential obstacles is increased
because the content of the music, the performance, and the listeners must all be
in harmony. When Kircher compares music to preaching, he says that an effective
preacher is familiar with his audience and therefore "knows which strings to
pluck"---a phrase that recalls Antonio de Azevedo's image of the religious
teacher with harp in hand.
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 551: "Nouerat enim prædicator fuorum auditorum
inclinationem; nouerat chordam, quam tangere debebat."]

But Kircher never fully resolves the tension between the universal power of
music and the variables of individual subjectivity and cultural conditioning. 
Music could, as Kircher describes, move someone to experience the truth of
religious teaching through affective experience, but only if the listener was
"the sort of man who was devoted to God"---that is, someone who already had
faith, whose temperament was already disposed to religious devotion of this
kind. If, as Kircher acknowledges, people of different nations are moved by
different kinds of music, and if individual people respond differently depending
on their temperament as well as their intellectual capacity, how could the
creators of sacred music be assured of its power?

Kircher's theory represents one attempt to reconcile the challenges of
accommodating the ear and training it. But outside the erudite realm of
theoretical speculation, this was a problem that faced every Catholic church
leader and musician who was serious about using music to make faith appeal to
hearing. How could the Church use music to accommodate hearing, when individuals
and communities did not hear the same way? The capacity to listen faithfully,
and therefore music's power to make faith appeal to hearing, would be limited by
both personal subjectivity and cultural conditioning, and these limitations
created anxiety and fear about the role of hearing in faith. 

## Danger and Doubt

### Subjective Experience in Faith

Regarding the problem of individual hearing, Reformation controversies had
pushed Catholics into an increasingly negative and anxious attitude toward
subjective religious experience. Polemicists like Thomas More accused Martin
Luther of turning his followers away from the trustworthy institutional Church
with its objectively operating sacraments, leaving them with only a subjective
experience as assurance of salvation, and separating individual faith from the
cultivation of a just society. 
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, ch. 4; @Schreiner:Certainty]

But for Catholics the problem remained that some connection needed to be forged
between individual people and the transcendent object of faith, namely God in
Christ, and no way of defining faith could completely remove the individual
element. The Roman Catechism says that faith means more than having an opinion
or conception of something---it "has the strength of the most certain agreement,
such that the mind, having been opened by God to his mysteries, firmly and
steadfastly gives assent." 
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 15: "Igitvr credendi vox, hoc loco putare,
existimare, opinari, non significat, sed vt docent sacræ litteræ, certissimæ
assensionis vim habet, qua mens Deo sua mysteria aperienti, firmè constantérq;
assentitur."] 
This theology of faith begins with God's grace opening the mind of the passive
person, but ends with an act of the individual will. 

The catechism preaches, in the tradition of Augustinian Neoplatonism, that God
the creator is above all created things that can be perceived through the
senses, and that therefore humans cannot come to the knowledge of God without
the gift of God's grace. "In order for our minds to reach God, since nothing is
more sublime than God, our mind needs to be pulled away from everything that
pertains to the senses---something that we, in this natural life, do not have
the capacity to do." 
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 18: "Nam vt mens nostra ad Deum, quo nihil est
sublimius, perueniat, necesse est eam omnino à sensibus abstractam esse: cuius
rei facultatem in hac vita naturaliter non habemus."]
But even as the catechism stresses that sensory experience is inadequate, and
human beings are incapable of knowing God by their own lights, it still speaks
of the knowledge of God in subjective terms: "our minds" must be changed, our
relationship to the world of the senses must be changed by divine action. Though
God is beyond sensation, sensation is the entrance to the path; the created
world speaks of God's nature to those who can perceive it. Each person is still
called to a process of seeking to know God, seeking to move beyond sensory
experience. 

As Susan Schreiner argues, the Catholic response to early modern debates about
the certainty of faith and salvation was to emphasize the work of the Holy
Spirit through the institutional Church.
[@Schreiner:Certainty, 131--208]
Not every individual perception or experience was valid, but only those that
accorded with the revelation already given through the Church. 

As a result, Spanish theological writers cultivated disciplines for regulating
spiritual experiences and submitting individual sensation to the Church's
authority. The Spanish Inquisition investigated Teresa of Ávila and other
mystics who claimed authority only on the basis of spiritual experiences, and
most were not as successful as Teresa in avoiding punishment.
[@Ahlgren:TeresaPolitics; Francisca:Inquisition]
Teresa's student Juan de la Cruz (St. John of the Cross) taught contemplatives
to pursue union with God by weaning themselves of sensory experiences in the
"dark night of the soul." The Carmelite reformer defines that union not in
sensual terms but in ethical ones, as the total surrender and conformity of
one's will to God.
[@Schreiner:Certainty; @JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. I, ch. 5--7, pp. 226--248]
Similarly, Ignatius of Loyola provided Jesuits with his *Spiritual Exercises*
for discerning the validity of their religious sensations.
[@Schreiner:Certainty, ch. 6]


In such a climate, music's power over the senses and affections might be used
for the purposes of cultivating faith, but this power could also be dangerous.
Some Catholics such as the Jesuit missionaries, despite their founder's
suspicion of music, were eager to use this power to advance the cause of the
Church. On the mission field, the Jesuits were involved with subjective
experience to such a degree that they even interpreted the dreams of native
people in New Spain.
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, 40--41; @Bailey:Art]
But others saw the use of music as a potential distraction or distortion. For
example, Juan de la Cruz complains that even though churches would seem the
ideal place for prayer, their decorations, ceremonies, and music so engage a
person's senses that it can be impossible to worship God "in spirit and in
truth" (John 4:23-24).
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 39--45, pp. 415--424]
Desiring "to feel some effect on oneself" in doing elaborate ceremonies "is no
less than to tempt God and provoke him gravely; so much so, that sometimes it
gives license to the devil to deceive them, making them feel and understand
things far removed from what is good for their soul."
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 43, p. 420: "Y lo que es peor es que algunos
quieren sentire algún efecto en sí, o cumplirse lo que piden, o saber que se
cumple el fin de aquellas sus oraciones ceremoniáticas; que no es menos que
tentar a Dios y enojarle gravemente; tanto, que algunas veces da licencia al
demonio para que los engañe, haciéndolos sentir y entender cosas harto ajenas
del provecho de su alma, mereciéndolos ellos por la propiedad que llevan en sus
oraciones, no deseando más que se haga lo que Dios quiere que lo que ellos
pretenden."]

In a strong counterpoint to Kircher's statement about music's power to augment
preaching, Juan admonishes his readers to be wary of overly artful preaching
which, like music, only serves to stimulate "the sense and understanding"---Juan
uses the exact language of the Roman Catechism---but has no impact on the
hearer's will to live faithfully:

> How commonly we see that [. . .] if the preacher's life is better, greater is
> the fruit that he gains though his style be low and his rhetoric scanty, and
> his teaching common, because the living spirit infuses him with ardor; but
> the other preacher gets very little gain, no matter how much more elevated
> his style and doctrine may be: because, though it is true that good style and
> actions and elevated doctrine and good language move and create more effect
> when accompanied by a good spirit, without the spirit, though the sermon may
> give the sense and understanding much to savor and enjoy, it infuses little
> or no sustenance to the spirit, because commonly it remains as lax and loath
> as before to labor, even though marvelous things were said in marvelous ways,
> which only serve to delight the ear [*oído*], like some polyphonic music
> [*una música concertada*] or the clanging of bells [. . .]. It matters
> little to hear someone perform one kind of music that is better than some
> other, if it does not move me more than the other to do works; because,
> although they have spoken marvels, then they are forgotten, as they do not
> infuse fire into the will.
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 45, p. 425: "Que comúnmente vemos que---cuanto
acá podemos juzgar---cuanto el predicador es de mejor vida, mayor es el fruto
que hace por bajo que sea su estilo, y poca su retórica, y su doctrina común,
porque del espíritu vivo se pega el calor; pero el otro muy poco provecho hará,
aunque más subido sea su estilo y doctrina; porque, aunque es verdad que el buen
estilo y acciones y subida doctrina y buen lenguaje mueven y hacen más efecto
acompañado de buen espíritu; pero sin él, aunque da sabor y gusto el sermón al
sentido y al entendimiento, muy poco o nada de jugo pega a la voluntad, porque
comúnmente se queda tan floja y remisa como antes para obrar, aunque haya dicho
maravillosas cosas maravillosamente dichas, que sólo sirven para deleitar el
oído, como una música concertada o sonido de campanas; mas el espíritu, como
digo, no sale de sus quicios más que antes, no teniendo la voz virtud para
resucitar al muerto de su sepultura. Poco importa oír una música mejor que otra
sonar, si no me mueve ésta más que aquélla a hacer obras; porque, aunque hayan
dicho maravillas, luego se olvidan, como no pegaron fuego en la voluntad."]

This passage of warning comes at the end of Juan's encyclopedic treatment of
contemplative practice and mystical experience, and it seems to deliberately
echo the "love" chapter of I Corinthians in insisting that, as Juan says
elsewhere, "a single work or act of the will done in charity is more precious
before God than all the visions and revelations and communications from heaven
that there can be."
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 2, ch. 22, p. 306: "[. . .] es más preciosa delante
de Dios una obra o acto de voluntad hecho en caridad que cantas visiones y
revelaciones y comunicaciones pueden tener del cielo."]
The contrast between this passage and the quotation from Kircher reflects not
only a chronological change in Catholic attitudes between the late sixteenth and
mid seventeenth centuries, but also a contrast between religious orders, and
differing emphases on parts of the Christian life. Juan's *Ascent of Mount
Carmel* was first published in 1618, though it was written some forty years
earlier; his outlook reflects the hard ascetic extreme of Catholic Reformation
attitudes toward music. Kircher, on the other hand, writes with the confidence
of the Jesuit order at the height of its global influence, when this order was
still trying to engage with any aspect of culture that they saw as advancing
their mission. Kircher is interested in music's power to convert---to not only
persuade catechumens of the truth but to enable them to experience truth. Juan,
on the other hand, is concerned with the limiting effect of sonic pleasures on
the maturity of the already converted. Both acknowledge music's power over the
individual person's senses, but Catholics who shared Juan's ascetic bent, or his
pastoral concern with spiritual growth, saw that power as a danger or even an
opening for diabolical influence. 

### Cultural Conditioning in Hearing

If reckoning with individual sensory experience was a struggle for the Church
after Trent, the problem of cultural conditioning in this period presented a
newer and more difficult challenge that profoundly changed the character of
Catholic Christianity. Catholics since the early age of exploration had
struggled to determine which parts of Christian religion they could adapt to
other cultures. As Ines \v{Z}upanov theorizes Jesuit intercultural encounters
in India in her book *Missionary Tropics*, the "tropics" represented both a
geographic zone and a process of inevitable "turning" or cultural
transformation.
[@Zupanov:MissionaryTropics]
Some missionaries like the Jesuits in Japan and Brazil actively sought to
accommodate local customs and music; but everywhere that missionaries brought
Christian faith, the process of cultural translation inevitably transformed it
into something neither they nor their converts could necessarily predict.
[@Bailey:Art; @Waterhouse:EarliestJapaneseContacts;
@Castagna:JesuitsConversionBrazil]

A half century after the Aztec empire fell to the Spanish, the Franciscan
Bernardino de Sahagún was trying to provide Mexica natives with suitable
Christian songs in their own language. 
[@Candelaria:Psalmodia]
But at the same time New-Spanish church leaders complained that there were often
no linguists sufficiently skilled in Náhuatl to verify that the songs and dances
of the natives were not secretly continuing to invoke demonic powers.
[@Candelaria:Psalmodia, 637]
Lorenzo Candelaria has made the provocative suggestion that the Council of
Trent's infamous decree that music should be preserved from anything "lascivious
or impure" may have been motivated more by anxiety about the songs in Native
American languages---and I would add, syncretic musical practices across the
globe---rather than concern about styles of European church music.
[@Candelaria:Psalmodia, 637--638]
<!--- XXX on Trent -->

We know in the realm of visual art that even where Jesuits wrote to their
superiors in Rome praising the natives' uncanny ability to copy European models,
the actual surviving artifacts often bear strong traces of indigenous methods,
aesthetics, and religious understandings.
[@Bailey:Art, 27--29, 34]
Likewise, given what we know about differing techniques and styles of vocal
production between places like central Africa and south India today, there is
every reason to think that music in mission churches and colonial cathedrals,
even plainchant and polyphony imported directly from Europe, sounded quite
different in actual performance from its European models. 

As the Church was adapting itself to native sensibilities, or being adapted by
colonial subjects in ways the Church could not fully control, how was the church
to accommodate its teaching to the "sense and intelligence" of all these
different people? The church could proclaim "the Faith," but how could leaders
know that people heard what they intended? And even more challenging, once these
processes of cultural adaptation and exchange had begun to "turn," what parts of
Christianity constituted "the Faith" that was supposed to come through
hearing? Did changing the musical style of worship, for example, mean changing
the Faith as well?

If ways of hearing music were culturally conditioned, then religious ear
training was required. The cultural aspect of acquiring a "properly trained
sense," as the Roman Catechism puts it, is plainly stated in a Latin dialogue
published by the leaders of the Jesuit mission in Japan in 1590.
[@Sande:DeMissioneLegatorum]
The missionaries had taken four Japanese noble youths on a grand tour of Spain
and Italy between 1582 and 1590. The boys practiced and performed music
throughout their trip, and heard the greatest ensembles of Catholic Europe in a
tour that included most of the major Iberian musical centers discussed in this
study: on the outgoing trip, Lisbon, Évora, Toledo, Madrid, and Alcalá; and on
the return, Barcelona, Montserrat, Zaragoza and Daroca. With this trip and with
the subsequent publication, the leader of the Jesuit mission to Japan,
Alessandro Valignano, hoped to persuade the authorities of his order and church
that "European Jesuits must accommodate themselves to Japanese manners and
customs." 
[@Massarella:JapaneseTravellers, 4]
The boys' mission was both to represent Japan to Europe and, on their return, to
represent Europe to Japan. 

In Colloquio XI of the dialogue, Michael, one of the "ambassadors," tells his
friend who stayed home about European music:

> You must remember [. . .] how much we are swayed by longstanding custom, or on
> the other side, by unfamiliarity and inexperience, and the same is true of
> singing. You are not yet used to European singing and harmony, so you do not
> yet appreciate how sweet and pleasant it is, whereas we, since we are now
> accustomed to listening to it, feel that there is nothing more agreeable to
> the ear. 
>
> But if we care to avert our minds from what is customary, and to consider the
> thing in itself, we find that European singing is in fact composed with
> remarkable skill; it does not always keep to the same note for all voices, as
> ours does, but some notes are higher, some lower, some intermediate, and when
> all of these are skillfully sung together, at the same time, they produce a
> certain remarkable harmony [. . .] all of which, [. . .] together with the
> sounds of the musical instruments, are wonderfully pleasing to the ear of the
> listener [. . .]. 
>
> With our singing, since there is no diversity in the notes, but one and the
> same way of producing the voice, we don't yet have any art or discipline in
> which the rules of harmony are contained; whereas the Europeans, with their
> great variety of sounds, their skillful construction of instruments, and their
> remarkable quantity of books on music and note shapes, have hugely enriched
> this art. 
[@Massarella:JapaneseTravellers, 155-156]

Michael's friend Linus responds with a statement that surely understates the
attitude of many non-Europeans whose ears had not yet been trained for European
music:

> I am sure all these things which you say are true; for the variety of the
> instruments and the books which you have brought back, as well as the singing
> and the modulation of harmony, testify to a remarkable artistic system. Nor
> do I doubt that our normal expectations in listening to singing are an
> impediment when it comes to appreciating the beauties of European harmony. 
[@Massarella:JapaneseTravellers, 156]

### Obstacles to Faith and Mistrust of Hearing

How, then, could the Church overcome such an impediment? What if a person simply
lacked the proper disposition to hear the Word with faith? The treatment of
Judaism in Spanish religious literature exposes cracks in early modern
Catholics' conception of faith and allows us to consider the anxiety and doubts
many people had about hearing and faith. 

In a Corpus Christi mystery play (*auto sacramental*) by Spanish court poet
Pedro Calderón de la Barca, the figure of *Judaísmo* becomes a vivid
representation of the incapacity to acquire faith, *despite* the sense of
hearing. Performed in 1634 to inaugurate Philip IV's new palace, the Buen
Retiro, Calderón's *El nuevo palacio del Retiro* centers on Judaism's incapacity
for faith.
[@Calderon:Retiro]
Judaism is forcefully excluded from the festivities celebrated within the play,
which culminate with the consecration of the Eucharist. Instead Judaism stands
to the side and asks the character Faith to explain each event to him
(`[ref:poem:Calderon-Retiro-Judaismo]`).
But despite trying to connect Faith's message with what he knows of the Hebrew
Scriptures, Judaism cannot accept any of these explanations. In fact he is unable
to believe what Faith has said, because, as he says in an increasingly
embittered refrain, "I have listened to Faith without Faith." 

`[float:poem:Calderon-Retiro-Judaismo]`

Judaism's eloquent confession of unbelief is immediately drowned out by music,
as clarion fanfares announce a royal procession. For Calderón's listeners, who
had been taught to regard Jews as the embodiment of willful unbelief and worse,
the entry of the musicians would clear away the acrid sound of Judaism's
speech. The feeling of doubt about the senses, however, pervades the entire
play. 

Much of the rest of the play dramatizes a contest of the senses, in which
Hearing prevails---but only after confessing to his own incertitude. Each
personified sense competes for a laurel prize awarded by Faith
(`[ref:poem:Calderon-Retiro-Hearing]`).  Each sense in turn boasts of his
powers, but Faith rejects each one. Hearing is the last sense to present
himself, and in contrast to the other senses, he speaks of his weakness, and how
easily he can be fooled by echoes or feigned voices. Since he cannot trust his
own powers, he must rely on faith. In response, Faith crowns Hearing precisely
because of his *desconfianza*---meaning lack of confidence, mistrust, and
humility. 

`[float:poem:Calderon-Retiro-Hearing]`

What would it mean, then, for hearing to be the favored sense of faith not just
because of its humility, but because of its actual weakness? Dominique Reyre
interprets the play as a straightforward medium for "transmission of dogma," and
Margaret Greer analyzes it anthropologically as a ritual that reinforced the
king's power; but neither scholar accounts sufficiently for the high degree of
uncertainty expressed on stage.
[@Reyre:Retiro; @Greer:Retiro]
How could an auditory art form like sacred drama, or the villancicos that
were usually performed in conjunction with them, provide a medium for
propagating faith or instituting social discipline, if hearing was so easily
deceived?

Calderón presents one character, Judaism, who hears what Faith says but lacks
the faith to believe it; and another, Hearing, who admits that he cannot trust
his own sense but for that very reason receives Faith's favor. In Calderón's
play, the mysteries of the Eucharist are beyond physical sensation: vision,
taste, touch, and smell would not lead to the truth of Christ's presence in the
host, but only hearing and believing Christ's words "This is my body" as spoken
by the priest. Fully in line with the discourse on sensation and faith in the
Roman Catechism, Calderón advises his listeners to trust some senses while
distrusting others; to seek God through sensation while purging themselves of
reliance on the senses. 

The dialectic of trust and doubt in the senses urged Catholics to rely on the
Church community and not their own experience. The senses were powerful, and
thus sensory art was powerful; but this power had to be harnessed to serve the
purposes of the Church. Simply put, faithful hearing required listeners to doubt
their own sensation. 

### Hearing the Word in Community

Catholic devotional music provided a practical medium for both appealing to the
ear and training it, though music amplified the challenges of acquiring faith
through hearing. Music could be a way to make faith pleasing to the ear, as
Kircher describes, but this only worked if the ear was trained to find such
music pleasing. Likewise, techniques that gave sense and meaning to
music---structures of phrasing, contrapuntal devices, symbolic and figurative
word-painting---were not universally intelligible. Religious ear training
required individual discipline to avoid the dangers of over-reliance on
subjective sensory experience. In an ideal Catholic scenario, musical training
also disciplined the whole community as participants through performance or
listening, and in missionary and colonial contexts, it required the community to
change its expectations of music to fit European norms. 

For this reason post-Reformation Catholics emphasized the Church as the source
of certainty in faith, as the living embodiment of Christ the Word in the world.
The virtue of man as Neoplatonic microcosm was reflected in the broader society
and in turn depended on it. Propagating faith, then, meant trying to establish
not just individual Christians, but also building a Christian society as the
body of Christ. For Roman Catholics, the Church was the gospel. 

As Catholics worked to create Christian communities, music was a potent tool for
creating harmony, for instituting social discipline as a reflection of the
heavenly hierarchy.
[@Baker:Harmony; @Irving:Colonial; @Illari:Polychoral]
This is why the Franciscan friars in New Spain and the Jesuit priests in Brazil
not only started parishes, but also trained choirs. The musical efforts of the
colonizing church concretely built social relationships through musical
training. Forming choirs of boys and training ensembles of village musicians in
colonial Mexico were practical means of establishing the Church and propagating
faith on individual and communal levels. Inculcating faith through music---the
kind of fully formed faith that resulted in a faithful life as part of the
community of the Church---meant more than a one-on-one dialogue between "the
music" and "the listener." The musical ritual of the seventeenth-century Church
involved a large number of community participants, for whom performing music
with the body and hearing it were inextricably linked. 

In terms of the most influential medieval music theorist Boethius (*De musica*
II), whose concept of music was foundational to the major Spanish music
treatises like that of Pedro Cerone, well-tuned *musica instrumentalis*
(sounding, played music) could harmonize the *musica humana*---the harmony of
the individual in body and soul, reason and passion, but also the concord of
human society.
[@Boethius:Musica, bk. II, pp. 187--189; @Cerone:Melopeo, 203--208;
@Baker:Harmony, 22--31] 
All this could better reflect the cosmic *musica mundana* and ultimately the
harmonies of the triune God. 

Catholic music, then, was not *about* society; it was a form *of* society. The
challenge of cultural conditioning led Catholics to experiment with, and argue
about, new ways of communicating across boundaries of language and customs.
Devotional music provided one way to make faith appeal to hearing, if some
way could be found to overcome the "impediment" of the "normal expectations in
listening to singing" of non-Europeans, as the Japanese ambassadors' dialogue
puts it. At the same time, Catholics of the seventeenth century were encouraged
to doubt their senses as much as to trust them; to submit their sensory
experience to the authority of the church; and to be wary of the possibility
that some people may lack the capacity for faithful hearing entirely. 

## The Primacy of Hearing in Villancicos

Villancicos manifest many of these same theological preoccupations and
anxieties. They do not answer the questions we have raised---in fact some of
them intensify the problems; but they do provide evidence for a broad public
discourse about sensation and faith even as these pieces of music were
themselves objects to be sensed and believed. 

Like most of the other sources discussed in this chapter, villancicos were
created by members of the literate elite, and thus they represent first of all a
discourse between those elite poets, musicians, and churchmen. At the same time,
though, villancicos were generally performed in public festivities with varied
audiences. Compared with the royal pomp and verbal virtuosity of Calderón's
Corpus Christi drama, for example, villancicos were performed in settings where
there could be more proximity between people of different social strata. 

It is legitimate to ask, as José María Díez Borque has done for Calderonian
drama, how much listeners could actually hear and understand of these complex
performances.
[@DiezBorque:Publico]
The same question should be asked of Italian opera, German sacred concertos, and
English anthems of the same period. There are not, at present, sufficient
sources to reconstruct the sociology of villancico audiences for all their
varied performance contexts around the world. But Margit Frenk argues that
Spanish literature of this period was written for the ear and that reading in
most cases meant one person reading out loud to an audience of illiterate family
and friends, whose auditory comprehension and memory would probably astound us
today.
[@Frenk:Voz]
And while we may not know exactly who listened to villancicos, the musical
sources do tell us what they heard with a far greater degree of specificity than
is possible for literature alone. 

Through vernacular poetry and likely also through musical style, the creators
and performers of villancicos addressed a broad public audience. These pieces
often represented complex theological concepts, but they made these concepts
accessible in quite a different way than a theological treatise or even a
sermon. As individual villancicos were repeated, and as conventional villancico
types were performed at multiple festivals each year, these pieces must have
shaped attitudes and beliefs in the broader community. 

### Contests of the Senses and Early Modern Concepts of Sensation

Two villancicos from Segovia in the later seventeenth century demonstrate how a
sophisticated discourse on sensation and faith was presented through devotional
music. The contest of the senses in Calderón's play is echoed in villancicos by
successive chapelmasters at Segovia Cathedral. Miguel de Irízar was born in 1634
and served at Segovia from 1671 until his death in 1684. Jerónimo de Carrión,
born in 1660, followed after Irízar in 1684 and died in 1721.
[@LopezCalo:Segovia]
Both chapelmasters set variants of the same villancico poem, *Si los sentidos
queja forman del Pan divino*, which was attributed to Zaragoza poet Vicente
Sánchez in the posthumous publication of his works in 1688.
[@Sanchez:LiraPoetica]

The Segovia Cathedral archive preserves manuscript performing parts for both
settings along with Irízar's draft score for his version. Irízar corresponded
with a peninsular network of musicians, often about exchanging villancico
poetry; he probably received this poem from a colleague in Zaragoza. He drafted
his scores on the backsides and in the margins of these letters in makeshift
notebooks. 
[The performing parts for Irízar's setting are in E-SE: 5/32; those for
Carrión's are in E-SE: 28/25. Irízar's letters and compositional process will
be discussed further in a later chapter. See also @LopezCalo:IrizarLetters1;
@Olarte:Irizar; @Rodriguez:Networks.]

The estribillo invites hearers to imagine the senses "filing a complaint"
against the bread of the Eucharist because "what they sense is not by faith
consented"---playing on *sentido*, the word for sense.

Each of the coplas treats a different sense, following nearly the same order as

The poem's treatment of the senses reflects a common physiological model of
sensation and perception, as educated Spaniards would have learned from the kind
of theological treatises preserved from seminary and convent libraries in Spain
and Mexico. Spanish theologians always treated Vision as the first and highest
of the five exterior senses. A typical example is the 1557 natural-philosophy
textbook *Phisica, Speculatio* by an Augustinian friar in New Spain, Alphonsus à
Veracruce. 
[@Veracruce:Phisica]
Veracruce summarizes the traditional Catholic teaching, which drew on Aristotle
as interpreted by Thomas Aquinas. 
<!--- \citXXX[Aristotle early modern] -->
Veracruce's Latin treatise accords with Fray Luis de Granada's widely read
Spanish *Introduction to the Creed* of 1583. 
[@LuisdeGranada:Simbolo; @LuisdeGranada-Balcells:SimboloPtI]

<!-- Table ref at beginning of this sentence -->
`[Ref:table_senses-fray-luis]` shows how Fray Luis explains the relationship of
the five exterior senses to the interior senses, including the affective
faculty, in which the sensory stimuli interacted with the balance of bodily
humors.
[@LuisdeGranada-Balcells:SimboloPtI, ch. 27--35, pp. 439--494]
The five exterior senses mediated between the outside world and the interior
senses by means of the ethereal *spiritus animales*, which were something like
invisible beams of light that flowed through the nerves. The cerebrum housed the
internal faculties, which "made sense" of what the external senses told
them---first the "common sense," a kind of reception area where the exterior
senses met the interior faculties; and next the imagination, the cogitative
faculty, and memory. All of these exterior and interior senses were part of the
*ánima sensitiva*, the sensing, reasoning soul. In addition to these senses the
*ánima sensitiva* possessed an affective faculty, in which the balance of humors
in the body interacted with the interior and exterior senses to produce
different "passions" or "affects" (Fray Luis uses *pasiones* and *afectos*
interchangeably). Based on a fundamental dichotomy like magnetism between
attraction and repulsion, this "concupiscible" part of the soul experienced
three primary pairs of passions: love and hate, desire and fear, joy and
sadness. 

`[float:table_senses-fray-luis]`

The act of sensation, then, involved the entire body and soul, in a
pre-Cartesian holistic model; but the external senses differed in how they
connected the external world to the internal faculties and passions. The
hierarchy of the senses was determined by the degree of mediation between the
object of sensation and the person sensing. The most base sense was taste,
because the person actually had to physically consume the object of sensation.
The most powerful sense was sight, since it enabled a person to perceive objects
a great distance away without any direct contact. 

Hearing stood out from the other senses because for it alone, the object of
perception was not identical with the thing sensed. As Calderón's character
Hearing says, "Sight sees, without doubting/ what she sees; Smell smells/ what
he smells; Touch touches/ what he touches, and Taste tastes/ what he tastes,
since the object/ is proximate [immediate] to the action."
[@Calderon:Retiro, ll. 577--582]
But Hearing hears a person's voice, not the person directly, as Calderón's text
continues: "But what Hearing hears/ is only a fleeting echo,/ born of a distant
voice/ without a known object."
[@Calderon:Retiro, ll. 583--586]
While this feature of hearing may have made it "easily deceived," it also gave
this sense a unique capability in spiritual matters, where the object of
perception was not immediately sensible at all. 

The poetic contests of the senses thus rearrange the traditional scholastic
hierarchy by putting Hearing at the end for a dramatic climax. Sight comes
first, but Hearing, the underdog competitor, triumphs at the
last.[^Irizar-ordering]
In the Sánchez villancico, each of the coplas highlights the failure of one of
the senses to rightly perceive the sacrament. For example, the eyes "do not look
at what they see," and the Eucharist reduces Sight to "blindness" (copla 1). The
"colors" and "rays of light" through which Sight normally operates are "hidden"
"beneath transparent veils" and "transformed" so that "God Incarnate is not
seen" (copla 2). Similarly, Touch may make contact with the host, but not with
the "mystery" hidden within (copla 3). Taste and Smell (coplas 5 and 6) are
similarly hindered by their ability only to perceive material accidents and not
spiritual substance. 

[^Irizar-ordering]: 
Irízar alone puts Hearing in its traditional position, though this goes against
the spirit of the poetic text; perhaps he was influenced by a scholastic
training to "correct" the philosophical order. 

Sánchez presents hearing in the last copla, through the conceit of music. The
senses are "five instruments" like a musical consort, which must be "tempered"
by faith. Without Faith, sight is actually blind, and touch, taste, and smell
are fooled; but when properly attuned by Faith, the senses can be harmonized
into a pleasing concord. Here Faith is not the object of sensation, but the
subject, who delights in hearing the music of properly tuned senses. 

### Staging the Contest in Sound: Irízar and Carrión at Segovia Cathedral

<!--- XXX Redo all measure numbers according to new edition -->

The two surviving settings of *Si los sentidos* by Irízar and Carrión stage this
contest of the senses in sound. Their contrasting styles invite different types
of involvement from listeners. In the earlier setting, for Corpus Christi 1674
at Segovia Cathedral (`[ref:music:Irizar-Si_los_sentidos]`), Miguel de Irízar
creates a musical competition in grand festival style by pitting his two
four-voice choirs against each other in polychoral dialogue.
[@Cashner:WLSCM32. E-SE: 5/32 is the manuscript performing parts in a copyist's
hand, while E-SE: 18/19 is the draft score in Irízar's hand, and includes the
heading, "Fiesta del SSantissimo de este año del 1674."]
<!--- page nos of edition -->

Polychoral dialogue, of course, is typical of large-scale villancicos, but
Irízar has the choirs interrupt each other in ways that create not just a
dialogue, but a debate. Like a film editor creating a fight scene, Irízar builds
intensity by cutting the text into shorter phrases to be tossed back and forth
between the two choirs: *no se den por sentidos* becomes *no se den* and then
*no, no*. 

`[float:music:Irizar-Si_los_sentidos]`

Irízar creates a steadily increasing sense of excitement through shifts of
rhythmic motion and style. The setting of the opening phrase suggests a tone of
hushed awe: the voices sing low in their registers, with a slow harmonic rhythm,
and pause for prominent breaths (mm. 1--9). The harmonies here change
less frequently than in the following sections, creating a relatively static
feeling for this introduction. In m. 10 Irízar has the ensemble switch
to ternary meter and increases the rate of harmonic motion. The sense of
antagonism is heightened when one choir interrupts the other with exclamations
of *no* on normally weak beats (mm. 13--14). When Irízar returns to
duple meter in m. 18, the voices move in smaller note values
(*corcheas*) and exchange shorter phrases, so that the tempo feels faster (and
the actual tempo could certainly be increased here in performance). Each choir's
entrances become more emphatic, repeating tones in simple triads, and Irízar
adds more offbeat accents and syncopations, particularly for *no se den por
sentidos los sentidos* in mm. 24--32. The estribillo builds to a
climactic *peroratio* with the voices breaking into imitative texture in
descending melodic lines. 

The distinguishing stylistic characteristics of the setting suggest that Irízar
is evoking a musical battle topic, a style one may find in *batallas* for organ
as well as other villancicos on military themes. 
[@Grove, s. v. *battle music*; @Sutton:IberianBatalla, who discusses examples
including those in Martín y Coll's *Huerto ameno de flores de música* (Madrid,
1709). Another villancico in this style is Antonio de Salazar's *Al campo, a la
batalla* (MEX-Mc: A28).]

Battle pieces typically feature a slow, peaceful introduction followed by
sections in contrasting meters and styles and a texture of dialogue between
opposing groups (as in between high and low registers on the keyboard). Typical
of the style is the reiteration of 5/3 ("root position") chord voicings, with
the bass moving by fourths and fifths, and the 3--3--2 syncopations on *no se
den por sentidos los sentidos* (mm. 25--26, 31--32, 43--46). 

Irízar sets the coplas, by contrast, in a sober and deliberate style. The melody
moves more calmly in duple meter with melodic phrases that fit well with the
rhetorical structure of the poetic strophes. Irízar has the treble soloist sing
the third and fourth lines of each strophe in short phrases, where the latter
phrase repeats the former down a fifth. This creates a feeling of a teacher
saying "on the one one hand" and "on the other hand" that suits the general
philosophical tone of the strophes and matches the specific poetic phrasing of
these lines. To recall the Jesuit formula, Irízar's estribillo seems more
designed to delight, while the coplas provide more of an opportunity to teach. 

Irízar's villancico seems to speak to a large crowd through grand, unsubtle
gestures and sharp contrasts of bright colors. By contrast, Jerónimo de
Carrión's later setting of the same poem invites a more personal reflection
(`[ref:music:Carrion-Si_los_sentidos]`). 
[E-SE: 20/5; @Cashner:WLSCM32]

`[float:music:Carrion-Si_los_sentidos]`

Carrión was capable of the festival style, as in his *Qué destemplada armonía*
(E-SE: 20/5), which almost takes on the dimensions of a *cantada*.
But this setting fits more in the subgenre of *tono divino* or chamber
villancico, a continuo song used in more intimate settings like Eucharistic
devotion. 
[See, for example, @Robledo:MadridTonos.]
The style is similar to the "high Baroque" music of contemporary Italy, with a
tonal harmonic language, a running bass part in the accompaniment, and a single
affective manner throughout. 

The dialogue and rivalry of the poetic text happens now not through polychoral
effects but through motivic exchanges between voice and accompaniment. Instead
of metrical contrasts from one section to the next, Carrión creates rhythmic
contrasts between simultaneous voices. Carrión dramatizes *queja* (m. 4) with a
metrical disagreement between the two voices (normal ternary motion versus the
voice's sesquialtera). The descending pattern of leaps for *porque lo que ellos
sienten* perhaps suggests the confusion and tumult of the senses, and it creates
a certain amount of rhythmic confusion as it moves between voices. Carrión
creates a climax through a canon between soloist and accompaniment in mm. 36--40
that leads the singer to the top of his register. The upward leaps in the last
line on *no se den* (m. 32) contrast with the downward leaping motive of the
opening (on *sentidos*, m. 1). 

The similarities between these two settings of *Si los sentidos* demonstrate the
persistence of concerns about the hearing's role in faith. Meanwhile the
differences between versions reflect different styles not only of composition
but of devotional practice. Irízar and Carrión take a verbal discourse on
sensation and faith, in which music is the paradigm of something that pleases
the ear, and bring it to life through actual music. Thus the pieces seem
designed to teach listeners how to hear music even as they are listening---they
accommodate hearing while training it, as the catechism says. 

### Sensory Confusion

While the *Si los sentidos* villancicos may not project as much uncertainty
about sensation and faith as does Calderón's *El nuevo palacio del Retiro*, they
still emphasize the need for all the senses to submit to faith, which means that
listeners should not trust their senses alone. Some villancico poets and
composers go further than stating that senses can be deceitful; they use paradox
to deliberately confuse the senses for pious purposes. We have already seen in
the previous chapter that many villancicos feature auditory "special effects"
like echoes, voices imitating instruments, and voices imitating birdsong. Such
pieces might be compared to the contemporary rise of *trompe l'oeil* effects in
visual art, like the illusion of the heavens opening in the *Transparente* of
Toledo Cathedral (by Narciso Tomé, 1732) or the false domes painted by Andrea
Pozzo and his students on Jesuit church ceilings from Rome to China.
[@GroveArt, s. v. *Tomé, Narciso*; @Bailey:Art, 110]

Villancicos with "synesthetic" topics mismatch the sense in the spirit of
paradox and enigma. 
[@DoetschKraus:Sinestesia explores connections between poetic "synthesis of the
senses" in Spanish verse and the actual neurological phenomenon of synesthesia.]
For example, sight and hearing are the principal objects in the anonymous
fragment *Porque cuando las voces puedan pintarla* (If voices could only paint
her) (E-Mn: M3881/44).

Cristóbal Galán, master of the Royal Chapel (1680--1684, after serving as
chapelmaster at Segovia Cathedral) juxtaposes hearing and vision in a villancico
for the Conception of Mary. 
[D-Mbs: Mus. ms. 2893, edition in @CaberoPueyo:PhD, 567--568]
Galán's text exhorts listeners to "hear the bird" and "see the voice."
The visual language in this villancicos evokes the common iconography of the
Holy Spirit as a dove surrounded by golden rays, such as may be seen in the
Monastery of the Encarnación in Madrid, where the Royal Chapel frequently
performed.
[@Sanz:GuiaDescalzasEncarnacion, 69--70, 81:
The image was painted on the ceiling of the monastery's Capilla del Cordero and
when a new church building was added later, this image was incorporated as the
central element atop the high altar.]

The poem makes "confusion" of sight and hearing, which is projected partly
through irregular poetic meter.[^Galan-meter]
<!--- \expoemref{expoem:Oigan_todos_del_ave-Galan} -->
In his musical setting for eleven voices in three choirs, Galán creates
*equivocación* through rhythm, notation, and texture. Galán juxtaposes the three
voices of Chorus I against the other two choirs by having Chorus I sing
primarily in a normal triple-meter motion (with dotted figures intensifying the
ternary feeling), while the other two choirs interject *¡Oigan!* and *¡Miran!*
in sesquialtera rhythm. 

[^Galan-meter]:
The division into lines is speculative, but the syllable counts and line
groupings in this arrangement could be scanned as 10, 6 10, 8 7 6, 6, 6 10, 10.

<!---
\begin{expoem} 
\caption{*Oigan todos del ave*, from setting by Cristóbal Galán, estribillo}
\label{expoem:Oigan_todos_del_ave-Galan} 
\inputexpoem{Oigan_todos_del_ave-Galan}
\end{expoem}
-->

To notate these rhythms, Galán must use white notes for the regular ternary
motion in Chorus I, but blackened noteheads (mensural coloration) to indicate
the hemiola pattern in the other choirs. But when each voice in Chorus I sings
the synesthetic phrase "the light is heard to shine," Galán turns the lights
out---on the page at least---by giving each voice a passage in all black-note
sesquialtera (`ref:figure:Galan-Oigan-coloratio`).
They return to white notation again for the following phrase, "while the voice
is seen in purity." Any attentive listener could hear these juxtapositions and
abrupt shifts in rhythmic patterns, though only the musicians themselves would
likely have recognized the dark--light symbolism in the notation. 
   
`[float:figure:Galan-Oigan-coloratio]`

In texture Galán plays with *qué equivocación* literally by setting these words
to an equal-voiced fugato on a long ascending scalar figure (starting with the
Tiple II's stepwise ascent A~4~--G~5~). The sudden outburst of
polyphonic texture in the midst of primarily homophonic polychoral dialogue
could create a more affective sense of confusion as well. As the estribillo
continues, Galán increasingly mixes up the music for *Oigan todos del ave*, the
sesquialtera interjections, and the contrapuntal texture of *qué equivocación*,
between the various choirs. 

Pieces like this describe and seek to incite a condition of sensory overload, an
ecstasy in which all the senses blend together in the effort to grasp something
that is beyond them.^[This notion is part of the Catholic heritage that shaped
Olivier Messiaen's concept of "dazzlement."]
Such pieces provide further evidence that Catholic religious arts could not be
reduced to the function of simply teaching doctrine; these pieces train the
senses by appealing to them directly. They seem intended to provoke listeners to
a higher form of sensation, to a holy dismay and wonder that would lead to true,
faithful perception. 

## Impaired Hearers, Incompetent Teachers: "Villancicos of the Deaf"

The problem of lacking the capacity for faithful hearing is evident
in villancicos that represent deaf characters. The final section of this chapter
presents two *villancicos de sordos*---villancicos of the deaf---which dramatize
the limitations of hearing, and poke fun at the difficulty some religious
teachers faced in making faith appeal to this sense. Similar pieces from both
sides of the Atlantic use hearing disability as a symbol of spiritual deafness:
the first is by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla from Puebla Cathedral in New Spain,
and the other is by Matías Ruíz for the Royal Chapel in Madrid. Both pieces
present mock catechism scenes with a friar and a man who is deaf or hard of
hearing. 

### Laughing at the Deaf: Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla (Puebla, 1651)

In a piece labeled *sordo* in the partbooks, Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla creates a
comic dialogue between a religious teacher and a "deaf" man named Toribio.
<!--- \expoemref{expoem:Oyeme_Toribio-Padilla} --> 
The villancico, which begins *Óyeme, Toribio* and is labeled as a "Dúo con
bajón," was performed in Matins for Christmas at Puebla Cathedral in 1651. 
[MEX-Pc: Leg. 1/2; @Stanford:Catalog; @Puebla:Microfilm]

It is part of Padilla's earliest surviving Christmas cycle for the new
cathedral, which had been consecrated in 1649. 
[Another villancico by Padilla is discussed in the next chapter. See also
@Cashner:Cards; @Mauleon:PadillaPalafox.]

Though two key partbooks are missing, including the Tenor I part who played the
deaf man, the dialogue can be reconstructed because the lyrics of the deaf man's
part were written in the surviving bass part.[^Sordo-performers]
The lyrics are preserved in one of the few imprints of villancico poetry from
Puebla to match up with surviving music, from Christmas 1651, currently
inaccessible in a private collection in Puebla. Gustavo Mauleón Rodríguez, who
alone has access to the collection, kindly shared with me a few pages of this
imprint but not the ones including this poem.
<!--- rewrite -->

[^Sordo-performers]:
The friar was played by the Altus I. The friar was probably accompanied by the
Bassus I on *bajón*, but this partbook is missing. The deaf man was played by
the Tenor I, but this partbook is missing. The deaf man was accompanied by the
Bassus II on *bajón*. Though the Tenor I solo music is missing, the lyrics for
the vocal part are written in above the accompaniment in the Bassus II part.
Thus we have the music for the friar without its accompaniment, and the
accompaniment for the deaf man and most of the lyrics, but not the deaf man's
music.

\inputexpoem{Oyeme_Toribio-Padilla}
\end{expoem}
-->

Playing with a conventional villancico type of a dialogue between a *docto* and
a *simple*---a learned man and a simpleton---Padilla's villancico stages a
parody of catechism instruction. The friar's attempts to communicate with the
"deaf" man fail, and this prompts the five-voice chorus to warn the congregation
against spiritual deafness. Padilla dramatizes the two characters' unsuccessful
attempts to communicate through disjunctions of rhythm and mode
(`[ref:music:Padilla-Sordo-intro]`).
Rhythmically, Padilla gives each singer a distinct "accent" in music: the
friar's musical speech is more fluent and sophisticated, while the deaf man's
speech is halting and clumsy, such as his questions "Eh? eh?" on an offbeat
figure. 

`[float:music:Padilla-Sordo-intro]`

Padilla illustrates the men's disagreement by having them fail to concur on
where to cadence. Given the one-flat *cantus mollis* signature, the cadence
points articulated by the extant bass part, and the final on F, Padilla probably
would have categorized this piece as mode 11 or 12.
[@Cerone:Melopeo, 873--882; @Judd:RenaissanceModalTheory;
@Barnett:TonalOrganization17C] 
The friar appropriately sings an opening phrase that surely would have cadenced
on F; but the deaf man responds with a phrase that cadences on C. At one point
the friar moves to a cadence on A, but the deaf man, responding that he can't
hear out of that ear, cadences on D. The friar says he will try the other ear,
but no sooner has the friar moved to D, than Toribio, saying, "Out of that ear I
hear even less!" moves to a cadence on C. This pushes the friar over the edge.
He bursts out, "You are a sheer idiot!"---mimicking the deaf man's halting
short-long rhythms, and returning to his own final of F. 

After the dialogue in the introducción, the Altus I, who has been representing
the friar, seems to turn away from the dramatic scenario and address the
congregation as a preacher: "The laughter of the dawn will turn to sobs," he
says---referring to the Virgin Mary as the dawn---when, having given birth to
the Word Incarnate, "her eyes see deaf men." Padilla sets the final phrase about
deaf men, with ten notes in black mensural notation that make a rhetorical
*catabasis* as they descend in a leaping melodic sequence.

When the rest of Chorus I joins in for the responsión, their repeated dotted
rhythm suggests vivacious laughter and comic offbeat sobs on *sollozos*
(`[ref:music:Padilla-Sordo-responsion]`). The catabasis figure is passed through
all the voices in imitation, leading to a harmonic catabasis when the Tiple I
adds E flat---shifting further away from the "natural" into the "weak" realm of
flats. 
<!--- \citXXX[chafe?] -->
The heavy syncopation in each voice creates rhythmic confusion that is not
sorted out until the final cadential flourish on F, validating the friar's
initial choice of mode. 

`[float:music:Padilla-Sordo-responsion]`

Through a mixture of sophisticated musical technique, high-minded theology, and
low caricature that is characteristic of this composer, Padilla belittles actual
deaf people as deficient, undignified, and deserving of laughter. Ironically,
Padilla's ensemble made their caricature at the same time that some Spanish
churchmen, like Juan Pablo Bonet, were engaged in actually ministering to deaf
people. 
[Juan Pablo Bonet, *Reduction de las letras y Arte para enseñar a ablar a los
mudos* (Madrid, 1620), cited and discussed in @Plann:DeafEducationSpain] 
<!--- more -->

But the creators of *villancicos de sordos* seem more interested in exploiting
the deaf to amuse and edify the hearing. Actual deafness is used here with the
main goal of pointing to spiritual deafness: the "deaf men" that will make Mary
weep are all people whose ears have been stopped by sin and cannot hear the
divine Word of Christ with faith. In his 1611 Spanish dictionary, Sebastián de
Covarrubias defines the *sordo* as "he who does not hear," rather than he who is
not *able* to hear. He adds, "There is no worse kind of deaf man than the one
who is unwilling to hear." 
[@Covarrubias:Tesoro, s. v. *sordo*: "SORDO, Lat. surdus, el que no oye. No ay
peor sordo que le que no quiere oyr."]

In this view, if hearing is the paradigm of faith, then deafness is its
opposite. While Calderón's Judaism heard Faith without faith, the deaf men in
villancicos cannot even hear Faith to begin with. 

### Learning from the Deaf: Matías Ruíz (Madrid, 1671)

The *Villancico de los sordos* by Matías Ruiz (E-E: Mús. 83-12) extends its
parody to the catechist as well. Ruiz was chapelmaster at the Real Convento de
la Encarnación in Madrid, and the poetry imprint survives from what must have
been the first performance there at Christmas, 1671.
[@1671-Madrid-Enc-Nav]
Here the *sordo* is a hard-of-hearing man, "very learned in humane letters"---a
doddering old university professor, or perhaps a street sage. The piece mocks
his impairment while contrasting true faith with the book learning of this
would-be humanistic scholar. But the biggest laughs come at the expense of the
friar, as the deaf man mishears his rote teaching formulas in increasingly
absurd ways.
<!--- (\expoemref{expoem:Pues_la_fiesta-Ruiz-estribillo}) -->

<!---
\begin{expoem} 
\caption{*Pues la fiesta del Niño es (Villancico de los sordos)*, from setting

\label{expoem:Pues_la_fiesta-Ruiz-estribillo}
\inputexpoem{Pues_la_fiesta-Ruiz-estribillo}
\end{expoem}
-->

The piece begins with soloist and chorus gleefully crying "On with the deaf
man!" rather like a bunch of high-school bullies, telling everyone to speak up
so he can hear. When the catechist and the *sordo* enter, Ruiz gives the two
characters phrases that contrast melodically, harmonically, and rhythmically, to
illustrate their inability to understand each other. The deaf man's musical
speech is abrupt, uncouth, and loud, fitting with the friar's mockery of the
deaf man's unmodulated voice (`[ref:music:Ruiz-Sordos-dialogue]`). The deaf man
bursts on the scene with a scale from the top of his register to the bottom
(F~4~ to G~3~). The descent across vocal *passaggi* would encourage the singer
to bawl the phrases in a coarse tone of voice. Ironically, a character with
impaired sensation of sound is marked for the audience primarily by the kind of
sounds he makes. 

`[float:music:Ruiz-Sordos-dialogue]`

Unlike in Padilla's villancico, here the deaf man has a lesson of his own to
teach. He may not be able to hear well but he has come with love to adore the
Christ-child. Acting as a kind of holy fool, and echoing Covarrubias's
definition of deafness, he reminds everyone within the sound of his voice that
the truly deaf are "those who neither listen nor understand the sound." 

In the catechism lesson presented in the coplas,
<!--- (\expoemref{expoem:Pues_la_fiesta-Ruiz-coplas-1}) --> 
the friar quizzes his pupil on key doctrines of Christmas, classic topics in
both scholastic and pastoral literature: Tell, *sordo*, he asks, how did God
fulfill his word to the prophet-king David?What motivated Christ to become
incarnate?[^Christmas-tropes]

[^Christmas-tropes]:
See the next chapter for a discussion of such classic tropes of Christmas
preaching in villancicos. 

But the deaf man mishears every statement: he mistakes *sordo* for *gordo*
(chubby), and *profeta* (prophet) as *estafeta* (mailman).

His supposed learning in the humanities leads only to confusion. When the friar
lauds the *bailes* (dances) of Christmas, and says *el portal es nuestro alivio*
(the stable is our remedy), the deaf man thinks he is citing *Tito Libio*. The
humanist is puzzled: he has read the Classical historian Livy, he says, but Livy
doesn't say anything about *frailes* (friars). 

Hearing that the child Jesus is shivering with cold, the deaf man suggests he
drink hot chocolate. The friar reassures him that "the Queen"---the Virgin
Mary---is keeping the child bundled, such that he glows with warmth (*arde*).
The deaf man now seems to feel that at last he has figured out what they are
talking about, and sums up with satisfaction, *Esta es, por la mañana y
tarde, la Reina de las bebidas* (Chocolate is, morning and evening, the Queen of
beverages). 

One can imagine that Ruiz's deaf man would invite the sympathies of listeners.
He is an earthy, common character, focused on material comforts. He is keenly
aware of the chill, as many older men are, and dotes tenderly onthe infant. The
deaf man's bumbling but endearing statements contrast strikingly with the friar's
abstract theology and clichéd poetic language. The text even reminds listeners
of the deaf man's response to mockery: he cannot hear the nine choirs of
Christmas angels, so he asks them to sing out loudly, as long as they don't say
anything bad about him. 

Ruiz's characters present a contrast of types of learning: the churchman who
repeats the same teaching points in every catechism class, versus an ersatz
humanist who has read Livy and perhaps Ovid but may not understand them at all.
Ruiz's hard-of-hearing humanities scholar demonstrates a central tenet of
Reformation-era Catholicism: that Classical learning alone is not enough to
understand Christianity.
[@Erasmus:Dolan, 206, "Erasmus perceived in the paganistic trends of the
Renaissance a greater threat to religion than the theological squabbles he was
so reluctant to participate in."]
Even so, the friar's inability to teach this man demonstrates yet again the
pervasive uncertainty about how faith could be made to appeal to hearing. 

Ruiz's *Villancico de los sordos*, like the other pieces we have discussed,
exalts hearing music as a means to faith---one which the deaf cannot understand.
This is because the word *son* in the epigrammatic conclusion of the estribillo
could mean not only sound but was also a term for a type of dance or song,
according to the 1610 dictionary of Covarrubias. The villancico is built on a
distinctive harmonic and rhythmic pattern of alternating ternary and
sesquialtera groupings, which are especially clear on the phrase *los que no
escuchan ni entienden el son* (`[ref:music:Ruiz-Sordos-son]`).
This pattern bears a close resemblance to dance forms known as *son* today
---most obviously, to the Mexican *huarache* familiar from the
song "America" in Leonard Bernstein's *West Side Story*.
[@Grove, s. v. *huarache*]
Even if the reference to *son* is not this specific, the music certainly evokes
the feeling of a social dance whose circle the deaf man is unable to join fully. 

`[float:music:Ruiz-Sordos-son]`

The creators of villancicos of the deaf could certainly have imagined that this
music was contributing to the goal of spiritual ear training. There may be a
higher theological point here about spiritual deafness, but both *sordo*
villancicos make the point at the expense of real people with disabilities.
Whether the music really accomplished that goal, or just provided amusement and
reinforced cultural stereotypes for commoners, is a question that haunts the
whole repertoire. In a pattern typical of this genre (and especially vexing in
the "ethnic" villancicos), someone on the margins of society is, through musical
representation, welcomed to Christ's manger, but the way he is represented
actually emphasizes his exclusion from the community.
[@Baker:EthnicVC; @Baker:PerformancePostColonial; @Cashner:PadillaRhythm-AMS]
At the same time they also demonstrate a surprising levity about the church and
its incompetent teachers. 

### Failures of Faithful Hearing

Critiquing both the poor level of theological knowledge among the lay people,
and the low quality of teaching among the clergy, were both characteristic
Tridentine postures.
[@Kamen:EarlyModernSociety, 56--57]
Antonio de Azevedo describes real-life scenes of failed catechesis:

> Some will say that the doctrine of the gospel has already been taught
> everywhere or almost everywhere (I am speaking of our Spain), and we concede;
> but there are so many parts that so badly lack anyone who could teach matters
> of faith, that indeed it is a shame to see it happen in many parts of Spain,
> and particularly in the mountains, where there are many so unlettered
> [*bozales*] in the matters of faith, that if you would ask them, how many are
> the persons of the Holy Trinity, some would say that they are seven, and
> others, fifteen; and others say about twenty---of this I am a good witness. 
>
> And a principal friar of my order, I've heard that once he was asking a woman
> how many [persons in the Trinity] there were, and she said, "Fifteen." And he
> said, "*Ay*, is that really your answer?" And then she wanted to correct
> herself, and she said, "*Ay Señor*, I think I was wrong---I'll say there are
> five hundred." 
[@Azevedo:Catecismo, 26: "Diran, o que ya ay dotrina del Euangelio en todas
partes, o casi todas (hablo de nuestra España) concedamoslo: Pero ay tanta falta
en muchas, de quien enseñe las cosas de la fe; que cierto que es lastima, verlo
que en muchas partes de España, y particularmente en montañas passa: a do estan
muchos tan boçales en las cosas de la fe, que si les preguntays, quantas son las
personas de la Santissima Trinidad, vnos dizen que son siete otros que quinze; y
otros veynte desatinos, de los quales yo soy buen testigo. Y a un frayle
principal de mi orden le oy, que preguntando el a vna muger, quantas eran, que
dixo ella que quinze, y diziendole el ay, y esso aueys de dezir? y ella se quiso
emendar, y dixo ay Señor, digo mi culpa, digo que son quinientas."]

Azevedo sees no humor in this lack of religious knowledge; and he faults not the
illiterate laypeople but the religious orders and clerics who have failed to
teach the basics of faith in a plain way, as Azevedo himself endeavors to do in
his book:

> It is a shame to see the ignorance that there is in many, in things of such
> importance [. . .]. Because even though the religious orders and those who
> preach do declare the gospel, they do not explain the ABCs [*b, a, ba*] of
> Christianity; they do not want to deal with giving milk because this is the
> task of mothers, those lordly Curates or Orators, who are responsible for
> this task, and what I have described is their fault. 
[@Azevedo:Catecismo, 27: "Es lastima ver la ignorancia que ay en muchos, en
cosas de tanta importancia: Y preguntados algunos qual de las tres personas
encarno, el vno dize, que el Padre otros que el Espiritu Santo: y en muy buenos
pueblos lo he oydo yo, hartas vezes con mis oydos; porque dado los religiosos y
los que predican declaren el Euangelio, no tratan del b,a ba de cristiandad, no
tratan de dar leche porque esse es officio de madres, de los señores Curas, o
Retores, a cuyo cargo esta esso; y cuya culpa es lo dicho."]

The friars of Padilla's and Ruiz's villancicos seem to fit with Azevedo's
description of "lordly orators" who delight in lofty language, rather than
motherly teachers who spell out the fundamentals of Christian faith. Azevedo's
critique, though, is motivated by the late-sixteenth-century Tridentine agenda
of reform and education; Juan de la Cruz makes a similarcritique of preaching
and music that delight the ears but do not effect the will. By the
mid-seventeenth century, though, the function of Catholic religious art under
developing "Baroque" aesthetics shifted away from the kind of"plain" instruction
Azevedo models, toward more ornate, learned, and often arcane forms of
expression. Composers of villancicos in the seventeenth century seem to have
followed an ideal closer to Kircher's Jesuit ideal of affectively powerful sacred
music attuned to the varying desires of a broad audience. 

Few villancicos of the seventeenth century would satisfy Azevedo's call to teach
the "*b, a, ba* of Christianity." Even the comic villancicos depend on learned
plays of language and music, like the Classical references in Ruiz's poetic
text, or the play on modal cadences and black notation of Padilla's music. This
means that the depictions of imperfect hearing in the villancicos of the deaf
themselves depended on the attention of listeners with well-trained ears. 

## "Make a Hedge around Your Ears"

To understand the role of villancicos in the dynamics of hearing and faith,then,
we must consider these performative texts as more than just one-way transmissions
of religious teaching from the Church to listening worshipers. They sometimes
raise more questions than they answer. The creators of these pieces seem to
expect listeners to be active, attentive, and intelligent. Indeed, Catholic
listeners in this period had to pay attention, because as multiple examples have
demonstrated, hearing was "the sense most easily deceived" and Catholics were not
expected to believe everything they heard. Hearing with faith meant questioning
anything that contradicted true faith and accepting the true faith even when it
contradicted the senses. 

Listeners who wished to overcome the dangers and uncertainties involved with
hearing devotional music were challenged to practice personal spiritual
discipline in hearing. This notion is encapsulated in an emblem by Sebastián de
Covarrubias, whose dictionary definition of deafness we discussed earlier 
(`[ref:figure:Covarrubias-Emblemas-202-ears-thorns]`). It
shows two fragile-looking human ears, protected from the buffeting four winds by
a crown of thorns. Its Latin motto is taken from Ecclesiasticus 28:28, "Make a
hedge around your ears with thorns."
[@Covarrubias:Emblemas, 202, "SEPI AVRES TVAS SPINIS."]
Covarrubias explains that our ears are endangered lest we "keep ourselves from
hearing flattery, gossip, lies, and false doctrines; and so that these things
will not reach our ears we must put a strong fence around them, and protect it
with thorns."
[@Covarrubias:Emblemas, 203, "Esse mesmo peligro tienen las orejas, sino las
apartamos de oir lisonjas, murmuraciones, mentiras, y falsas dotrinas: y para
que no lleguen a nuestros oydos deuemos hecharles van fuerta cerca, y vardarlas
con espinas."]
"In this life, which is a battle," he warns, "if you wish to keepyourself safe,
take refuge in Christ and his crown."
[@Covarrubias:Emblemas, 202: "En esta vida, que es vna milica,/ Si asegurar
quisieres tu persona,/ Amparate de Christo, y su corona."]

Even if, then, the Church successfully made Christ the Word audible to the
world, accommodating its teaching to the sense and intelligence of people of
varying temperaments and cultural backgrounds, faithful hearing for Catholics
still required individuals to discipline their ears to focus on Christ.
Villancicos provided both an opportunity to hear the Word and a challenge
to discern it and live accordingly. From a modern perspective, it would seem that
some villancicos posed more of challenge in this respect than others, and not
for the reasons that their creators might have intended: did the caricatures of
deaf people in villancicos really move many listeners beyond simple mockery? Did
the special rhetorical effects of villancico poetry and music edify more than
they entertained? Or were such distinctions unimportant at the time? In any case,
the fundamental Tridentine problem, of making faith appeal to hearing by both
accommodating the senses and training them, remained a challenge for Catholics,
both those who would teach through speech or song and those who would listen.
