# Making Faith Appeal to Hearing

> | I cannot comprehend you nor know your enigma,
> | because I have listened to Faith without faith.
> | --- "Judaism," in Calderón, *El nuevo palacio del Retiro*

St. Paul wrote to the Christian community in Rome, "How are they to believe if
they have not heard?," since "faith comes through hearing, and hearing, by the
Word of Christ" (Rom. 10:16--17). Sixteen centuries later, amid the ongoing
reformations of the Western Church, Catholic Christians were seeking ever new
ways to make faith audible. Poets and composers of the Spanish Empire expanded a
genre of sung poetry in the vernacular---the villancico---into large-scale
choral and instrumental performances that could appeal to the ears of elite and
common people alike
[The major studies of the villancico as a musical and poetic genre are, in
chronological order, @Rubio:Forma; @Laird:VC; @Torrente:PhD; @Tenorio:SorJuana;

With the Church's active patronage, villancicos became a central activity in
religious festivals throughout the year, particularly at Christmas, Corpus
Christi, and the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Church ensembles performed these
pieces, with their motet-like refrains or *estribillos* surrounding a set of
strophic verses or *coplas*, as an integral part of Matins and other liturgies.
Festival crowds from Madrid to Manila also heard villancicos in public
processions and in conjunction with mystery plays. Villancicos expressed
widespread beliefs and attitudes while also shaping them.

A large number of villancicos begin with calls to listen---*escuchad*,
*atended*, *silencio, atención*. Because so many villancicos explicitly address
concepts of music, sensation, and faith, these remarkable but understudied
pieces offer us unique insights into how early modern Catholics understood the
supernatural power of music. How, then, did the people who created, performed,
and listened to villancicos understand music's role in the relationship between
hearing and faith?

This chapter explores the theological climate in which villancicos were created
and heard, considering theological literature on faith and hearing, and
villancicos that treat these themes explicitly. I argue that villancicos
provided a way for church leaders to make faith appeal to the hearing of a broad
range of listeners, while also creating opportunities for listeners to consider
the nature of hearing itself. Villancicos thus fulfilled one of the central
prerogatives of the Catholic teaching after Trent, to accommodate the sense of
hearing even while training it. 

At the same time, I argue, villancicos manifest certain widespread anxieties
about the role of sensory experience in faith.  Spaniards and their colonial
subjects worried about how to listen faithfully, about the role of subjective
experience and cultural conditioning, and about the possibility that some
listeners might lack the capacity to hear music rightly. Understanding
villancicos in their theological context, and interpreting villancicos as
theological sources in themselves, reveals varied and sometimes conflicting
beliefs about faith and hearing. The discourse on faith and hearing in
devotional poetry and music often raises as many questions as it answers; but
this tension, I argue, is actually central to its ability to both accommodate
the senses and train them. 

We will begin by discussing theological and literary sources that reveal
tensions in theological formulations of faith, hearing, and music. Then we will
look at a group of related villancicos, never previously edited or studied, that
manifest the same tensions. The first two pieces stage allegorical contests of
the senses in which hearing is the favored sense of faith; other pieces
deliberately confuse the senses to point to a higher truth that is beyond
sensation. The last two pieces are "villancicos of the deaf": they
represent characters whose impairments of hearing render them unable to
understand religious teaching. 

If we listen closely to villancicos as historical sources for theological
understanding, it becomes clear that villancicos functioned as much more than
vehicles for simplistic religious teaching or as banal, worldly entertainment.
The villancicos in this chapter appeal to the ear in order to give listeners an
opportunity to contemplate the challenges of faithful hearing. 

## Accommodating and Training the Ear

Catholic theologians of the Tridentine era emphasized the need for the Church's
teachers to make faith appeal to hearing, and the Church used devotional music
like villancicos in that endeavor. Catholic writers taught that since faith came
through hearing, as St. Paul said, ministers must accommodate their teaching
to the sense of hearing of their parishioners. They did not, though, view
hearing alone as completely trustworthy. Even if faith came through hearing, one
could not believe everything one heard; and thus Catholics emphasized not only
accommodating hearing, but training it. 

Though the Protestant reformers insisted that their teachings were a return to
true biblical orthodoxy, Catholic theologians believed that the reformers had
redefined faith completely. In contrast, Catholics continued to develop the
theology of faith they inherited from medieval writers like Thomas Aquinas, in
which faith was one of three virtues or capacities, along with hope and
charity [@Schreiner:Certainty, 130--132]. Simple belief in intellectual
propositions was "unformed faith" (*fides informe*); it was essential that every
Christian believe certain things, but this was not the summit of Christian life.
The goal was that Christians would develop fully "formed faith" (*fides
formata*), which "worked through" the two higher virtues to result in what might
best be translated as "faithfulness." True faith was a conviction that
manifested itself through ethical behavior in fidelity to God's will 
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, s. v. *Credo in Deum Patrem*, 15--20].

For Catholics, then, faith encompassed beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors; and it
connected individuals experience with ethical action as part of the community of
the Church. A man of faith was a man of virtue (the root of *virtus* being
*vir*), and thus faith was central to the Catholic Humanist goal of building a
virtuous society. Christian disciples had to not only "hear" the Church's
teaching and believe it (this would be unformed faith); they also had to
"listen" in the sense of obeying. 

### Hearing Christ the Word

A central document for understanding the faith of post-Reformation Catholics is
the catechism "for parish priests" commissioned by the Council of Trent and
first published in 1566 [@Catholic:Catechismus1614; @NewCatholic, s. v.
*catechism*]. In responding to both the challenge of Protestantism and the
underlying problems that had allowed heresy to take root, the council's bishops
sought to improve the education of clergy and laity in matters of faith. They
required priests and bishops to preach on all Sundays and holy
days [@NewCatholic, s. v. *Trent, Council of*].

The catechism was a model for teaching the clergy how to preach and teach---a
guide both to the content of Catholic faith and to the best ways of making the
faith heard and understood. Vernacular expositions of the catechism, like the
Spanish versions of Antonio de Azevedo, Juan Eusebio de Nieremberg, and Juan de
Palafox y Mendoza, brought this teaching down to a more colloquial level for (in
Palafox's words) "laborers and simple folk," with earthy illustrations and
paraphrases of Biblical stories [@Azevedo:Catecismo;
@Nieremberg:PracticaCatecismo; @Palafox:Bocados]. These texts come alive when
read aloud, and indeed the primary goal of this type of literature was to
prepare pastors to teach unlettered disciples through words and voice, whether
those disciples were the "Indians" of America or Asia, or the peasants of Europe
whose customs were still more pagan than Christian 
[On Europe as a mission front after Trent, see @Kamen:EarlyModernSociety,
60--63.].

In the Roman Catechism, hearing is central to faith because the object of faith
is Christ, the Word of God, and the Church's mission is to make that Word
audible. According to the catechism's preface, God communicated his own nature
to humanity by taking on human flesh in Christ. Therefore the true Word of God
was not confined to Scripture or doctrines alone---the Word was a person, Jesus
Christ, to whom the prophetic scriptures testified and from whom the Church's
doctrine flowed
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 9: "Omnis autem doctrinæ ratio,
quæ fidelibus tradenda sit, verbo Dei continetur, quod in scripturas,
traditionesque distributum est."].
In the words of John's gospel, Jesus Christ himself was the *logos* or *verbum*
(John 1:1), the "Word made flesh." Where God had spoken through the law and the
prophets, now he had spoken through his Son (Heb. 1:1). 


The catechism builds its ecclesiology, or its theology of the church, on this
theology of the Incarnation. Christ, the incarnate Word, appointed apostles,
chief among them St. Peter, to be the custodians of the true faith. The
community of the Church, then, was the sacramental means through which people
would come to know Christ after his resurrection. 

There was thus a close link in Catholic theology between hearing the Word of the
Church's teaching, obeying that Word, and encountering Christ who was the Word.
The absolute center of the Church's teaching, according to the catechism, was
found in Christ's own words in John 17:3, "This is eternal life, that you should
know the only true God, and the one whom he sent, Jesus Christ"
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 6: "Hæc est vita æterna, vt cognoscant te solùm
verum Deum, & quem misisti, Iesum Christum."]. 
All the Church's teachers should exert themselves to the end that 

> the faithful should know and love from the heart Jesus Christ, and him
> crucified [I Cor. 2:2]; and indeed to persuade them so that they
> believe with the faithfulness [*pietas*] of their inmost heart and with
> cultivated devotion [*religio*], that there is no other name given to people
> under heaven, through whom they can be saved [Acts 4:12], since Christ is the
> atonement for our sins [I John 2:2] 
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 6: "Quamobrem in eo
præcipuè Ecclesiastici doctoris opera versabitur, vt fideles scire ex animo
cupiant, Iesum Christum & hunc crucifixum: sibíque certò persuadeant, atque
intima cordis pietate, & religione credant, aliud nomen non esse datum hominibus
sub cœlo, in quo oporteat nos saluos fieri: siquidem ipse propitiatio est pro
peccatis nostris."].

Finally---contrary to Protestant teaching as Catholics understood it---since "in
this we know that we know him, if he keep his commandments" (I John 2:3),
teachers should model faithful living, "not in leisure" but "in applying
diligent effort to justice, piety, faith, charity, mercy," having been redeemed
"to do good works" (I Tim. 2:12); so that "whether one sets out to believe or
hope or do anything," the love of God should be the summit of all Christian
life
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 6--7: "At verò quia in hoc scimus,
quoniam cognouimus eum, si mandata eius obseruemus, proximum est, & cum eo,
quod diximus, maximè coniunctum, vt simul etiam ostendat vitam à fidelibus non
in otio, & desidia degendam esse, verùm oportere, [. . .]  sectemúrque omni
studio iustitiam, pietatem, fidem, charitatem, mansuetudinem: dedit enim
semetipsum pro nobis, vt nos redimeret ab omni iniquitate, & mundaret sibi
populum acceptabilem, sectatorem bonorum operum [. . .].  Siue enim credendum,
siue sperandum, siue agendum aliquid proponatur, ita in eo semper charitas
Domini nostri commendari debet [. . .]."].

How, then, could the Church communicate the Word through the sense of hearing?
Drawing on St. Paul's dictum from Romans, the catechism challenges the Church's
ministers to find a way to make Christ the Word audible:

> Since, therefore, faith is conceived by means of hearing, it is apparent, how
> necessary it is for achieving eternal life to follow the works of the
> legitimate teachers and ministers of the faith. [. . .] Those who are called
> to this ministry should understand that in passing along the mysteries of
> faith and the precepts of life, *they must accommodate the teaching to the
> sense of hearing and intelligence*, so that by these [mysteries and precepts],
> *those whose senses have been trained* should be filled up by spiritual
> food
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 2, 8--9 (emphasis added): "Cvm
autem fides ex auditu concipiatur, perspicuum est, quàm necessaria semper fuerit
ad æternam vitam consequendam doctoris legitimi fidelis opera, ac ministerium [.
. .] vt videlicet intelligerent, que ad hoc ministerium vocati sunt, ita in
tradendis fidei mysteriis, ac vitæ præceptis, doctrinam ad audientium sensum,
atque intelligentiam accommodari oportere, vt cùm eorum animos, qui exercitatos
sensus habent, spirituali cibo expleuerint [. . .]."].

Pastors should consider "the age, intelligence [*ingenium*], customs, condition"
of their charges, to give milk to spiritual infants and solid food to the
maturing, to raise up a "perfect man [*virum perfectum*], after the measure of
the fullness of Christ"
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 8: "Obseruanda est enim audientium ætas, ingenium,
mores, conditio [. . .].  sed cùm alij veluti modò geniti infantes sint, alij
in Christo adolescere incipiant, nonnulli verò quodammodo confirmata sint ætate,
necesse est diligenter considerare, quibus lacte, quibus solidiore cibo opus
sit, ac singulis ea doctrinæ alimenta præbere, quæ spiritum augeant, donec
occurramus omnes in vnitatem fidei, & agnitiones filij Dei, in virum perfectum,
in mensuram ætatis plenitudinis Christi."].

Thus the catechism teaches that for faith to come through hearing, both the
teacher and the listener had to be involved. This concept was echoed in the 1589
Spanish *Catechism of the Mysteries of the Faith* by Antonio de
Azevedo [@Azevedo:Catecismo]. This catechism begins with an image taken from
Pliny, which depicts a religious teacher with a pupil at his feet and a harp in
his hand. The teacher is shown, Azevedo says,

> with a musical instrument which gives pleasure to the ear, so that we should
> understand that Faith enters through the ear [*oído*], as St. Paul says, and
> that the disciple should be like a child, simple, without malice or duplicity,
> without knowing even how to respond or argue, but only how to listen and
> learn. Thus this image depicts for us elegantly, what the hearer of the Faith
> should be like 
[@Azevedo:Catecismo, f. 1b: "Para pintar los Romanos la
Fe, lo primero que hizieron templo y altar [. . .] Numa pompilio [. . .] puso vn
idolo: de forma de vn viejo cano, que tenia vna harpa en la mano, i estava
enseñando vn niño echado a sus pies. En esta figura o geroglifica esta encerrada
mucha filosofia, i aun cristiana. En el templo i ara denota, que la fe a de ser
firme i fixa, no movediça, ni flaca, que a cada ayre de novedad se mueva I
tambien que a menester maestros que la enseñen, i dicipulos que la oygan. I, que
el maestro a de ser anciano, i maduro en edad y bondad. Porque la dotrina es
grave, antigua, i de tomo i sustancia. No nueua, ni de pocos años sino antigue
dende los Apostoles, i con instrumento musico que da gusto al oido. Paraque
entendamos, que la Fe entra por el oido; como dize S. Pablo. I que el dicipulo
sea como niño, sencillo, sin malicia ni doblez, sin saber ni replicar, ni
arguir, mas de solo oir, y deprender. En lo qual nos dibuxa galanamente, qual a
de ser el oiente de la Fe."].


The teacher's task according to Azevedo, then, is not only to make the faith
heard, but to make it "appeal to the ear," just as he says music does. But such
teaching was limited by the sensory capacity of each listener, and therefore the
Roman Catechism argues that the task of listening requires the sense to be
properly trained. Thus pastors had to accommodate the ear even while training
it. 

How could the Church use music, then, in the effort to make Christ the Word
audible? The catechism's theology might suggest that music would contribute to
propagating faith because this medium could appeal in a special way to the sense
of hearing. If teaching should appeal to the ear *like* music, as Azevedo says,
then combining teaching with actual music would appeal all the more.
Villancicos, as an auditory medium based on poetry in the vernacular, would seem
like an ideal tool for accommodating the faith to Spanish-speaking listeners'
"sense and intelligence." At the same time, the challenge of training their
sense of hearing would seem to be multiplied with music, since the listeners
must learn to understand not only spoken language but musical structures as
well. In other words, music would seem to be a way of better accommodating faith
to the sense of hearing, but it also required more training to be heard in a
faithful way. 

### Experiencing Spiritual Truth through Music

This tension between accommodating the ear and training it may be seen in the
explanations of music's power by Athanasius Kircher. This Jesuit polymath's
compendium of musical knowledge, *Musurgia universalis*, was published in Rome
in 1650 and thence disseminated throughout the Hispanic world, with copies sent
to centers of colonial culture including Puebla and Manila 
[On the worldwide distribution of the book as far as Manila, see
@Irving:Colonial, 48--50. The book may be found in historical collections in
Madrid, Barcelona, Mexico City, and Puebla (two copies). On Kircher, see
@Findlen:Kircher, @Godwin:KircherTheater.].

Kircher discusses the power of music several times throughout his ten-part
treatise, including a detailed analysis of "whether, why, and what kind of power
music might have to move people's souls, and whether the stories are true that
were written about the miraculous effects of ancient music" 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. VII, 549: "Vtrum, cur, & quomodo Musica uim habeat ad
animos hominum commouendos, & vtrum vera sint, quæ de mirificis Musicæ Veteris
effectibus scribuntur."].
Kircher's contribution to this favorite controversy of the Renaissance is to
defend the superiority of modern music on the basis of, among other factors, its
increased ability to move listeners through varieties of musical structure and
style. 

For Kircher, music added such power to words, that it could move a listener not
only to understand the subject of the words, but to physically experience their
truth. According to legend the famed *aulos* player Timotheus aroused Alexander
the Great to the furor of war through music, and Kircher says he did this by
adapting his song both to the feeling of war and to the disposition of the
king.[^Timotheus-sources]

[^Timotheus-sources]: 
Kircher is probably responding to Vincenzo Galilei, *Dialogo della musica*
(Florence, 1581), 90, in discussing the Classical source, Dio Chrysostom,
*Orationes* 1 (*Peri Basileias*); a later treatment of this subject is John
Dryden, *Alexander's Feast, or the Power of Music* (London, 1697).

The same music, he says, would have had a different effect on someone else; and
to illustrate this contrast, Kircher goes on to paint a remarkable picture of
how sacred music can move those who are disposed to it:

> If, on the other hand, [the musician] addressed the sort of man who was
> devoted to God and dedicated to meditation on heavenly things, and wished to
> move him in otherworldly affects and rapture of the mind, he would take up
> some notable theme expressed in words---a theme that would recall to the
> listener's memory the sweetness and mildness of heavenly things---and he would
> fittingly adapt it in the Dorian mode through cadences and intervals, then
> [the listener] would experience that what was said was actually true, those
> heavenly things that were made by harmonic sweetness, and he would suddenly be
> carried away beyond himself to that place where those joyful things are true
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. 7, 550: "Sicuti contra, si quis Deo deuotum hominum
rerumque cœlestium, meditationi deditum in exoticos affectus raptusque mentis
commouere vellet is supra insigne aliquod verborum thema, quod rerum cælestium
dulcedinem, & suauitatem auditori in memoriam reuocaret, modulo dorio per
clausulas interuallaque aptè adaptet, & experietur quod dixi verum esse, statim
extra se factos dulcedine harmonica eò, vbi vera sunt gaudi rapi: vidi ego
nonsemel in viris ordinis nostri sanctitate illustribus huiusmodi
experimenta."].

Kircher says that the experience of Jesuit missionaries around the world
provides ample evidence of this miraculous power of music combined with
preaching. But Kircher's depiction of music's power goes well beyond the Jesuit
formula of "teaching, pleasing, and persuading" 
[On the Jesuit approach to religious arts, see @Bailey:Art, 35--51.].

Music not only makes the teaching of doctrinal truth appealing and persuasive;
it actually transforms listeners through affective experience. In this
conception, music links the objective truth with subjective experience through
the unique ways that music affects the human body. Through principles of
sympathetic vibration, the humoral-affective properties of music could be
transferred from composer and performer to listeners. 

This passage in Kircher's Book VII comes in the midst of a comparison between
the fabled powers of music in the ancient world versus the possibilities for
moving the affections in contemporary music. Kircher argues that music moves a
listener's soul through sympathetic resonance that creates harmony between the
numerical proportions of the music and the humoral composition of the listener.
The various modes and styles of modern music, which Kircher catalogues in
detail, apparently have inherent affective properties: the Dorian mode, for
example, is suited to grave and pious religious sentiment. For Kircher, modern
music was superior to ancient music not because it operated according to
different principles, but because modern musicians had found ways to extend and
amplify the same principles that made ancient music effective. 

The fundamental principle that gave music its affective power was sympathy 
[On the links between this interest in the occult powers of music and early
scientific research, see @Gouk:Sciences; @Gouk:Harmonics.].
Music created physical harmony---sympathetic vibration---between the affective
subject of the music (that is, what the music was meant to express), and the
listening subject, so that the music moved in the same way as the affections it
expressed, and this in turn moved the listener to the same affections. 

Music with different intervallic relationships, with the semitone placed
differently in different modes, produced different effects. Kircher explains:

> Since harmony is nothing other than the concord, agreement, and mutually
> corresponding proportion between dissimilar voices, this proportion, then, of
> numbers, sets the air in motion; the motion, indeed, is to be varied by the
> ratios of various intervals, ascending and descending; so that the spirits [i.
> e. , *spiritus animales*], or the implanted internal air [. . .], should be
> moved according to the proportions of the motion of the external air, so that
> the spirits' motion are effected in various ways; and through this affections
> can be engendered in the person
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 552: "Cum harmonia nihil aliud sit, quam dissimilium vocum
concordia, consensus, & undequaque correspondens proportio; proportio autem
numerorum in motu aeris elucescat; motus verò pro varia interuallorum, ascensus,
descensusque ratione varius sit, spiritus quoque, siue aer internus implantatus,
vti paulò ante ostensum fuit, iuxta proportionem motus aeris extrinseci
moueatur, fit vt spiritus moti ope varie, indè in homini affectiones
nascantur."].

The structure of the music's movements must correspond to the movements of the
body's humors. Kircher theorizes four conditions that are necessary for music to
achieve an effect; without any one, music will fail to move the listener in the
intended way:

> The first is harmony itself. Second, number, and proportion. Third, the power
> and efficacy of the words to be pronounced in music itself; or, the oration.
> Fourth is the disposition of the hearers, or the subject's capacity to
> remember things
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550: "Tertius purè naturalis est, per harmonicum, scilicet
sonum, qui nisi quatuor conditiones annexas habeat, quarum vna deficiente,
desideratus effectus minimé obtinebitur: Prima est ipsa harmonia.  Secunda,
numerus, & proportio.  Tertia, verborum in ipsa musica prouniciandorum vis, &
efficacia, siue ipsa oratio.  Quarta audientis dispositio, siue subiectum
memoratarum rerum capax."].


If there must be this kind of congruence between music and listener, then it
makes sense that Kircher acknowledges that music affects different people in
different ways. First, Kircher concedes that geographic and cultural factors
influence music style and its effect, such that Italians and Germans are moved
by different styles and therefore compose differently. These national styles, he
says, are the result of a national "genius" (that is, the special gift of that
people), as well as environmental factors, such that Germans draw a grave style
from living in a cold climate, contrasted with the more moderate style of
Italians. People of the Orient who visit Rome, Kircher says, do not enjoy the
highly delicate music of that city, and prefer their own strident, clangorous
music. These differences of style and perception are caused by patriotism---the
inordinate love of things from one's own country, as Kircher describes it; and
by what each person is accustomed to hearing, which is shaped by the traditions
of each country 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 543--544].

<!--- XXX translation in Strunk -->

Moreover, "just as different nations enjoy a different style of music, likewise
within each nation, people of different temperaments appreciate different styles
that conform the most to their natural inclinations" 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 544: "Quod quemadmodum diversæ nationes diuerso stylo musico
gaudent, ita & in vnaquaque natione diuersi temperamenti homines, diuersis
stylis, vnusquisque suæ naturali inclinationi maximè conformibus afficiuntur."].
What delights a person with a sanguine temperament might enrage or madden a
melancholic listener; what has a strong effect on one person may have no effect
at all on another [@Kircher:Musurgia, 550]. 
"Music does not just move any subject, but the one with which the natural humor
of the music is congruent [. .  .] for unless the spirits of the receiving
subject correspond exactly, the music accomplishes nothing" 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 550: "Musica igitur vt moueat, non qualecunque subiectum
vult, sed illud cuius humor naturalis musicae congruit [.  . .] quæ nisi
recipientis subiecti spiritui extactè respondeant, nihil efficient."].
Furthermore, Kircher suggests that not only humoral temperament but alsotraining
and intelligence are a factor in individual listening, since he includes the
capacity of memory in his list of four conditions for effective music. 

Despite Kircher's confidence in modern musicians' ability to make music music
move people, the conditions he names may not have been as easy to fulfill as he
suggests. There must be congruence, first of all, between the structure of the
music and subject of that music: the music must move in the same way as the
affective movements it seeks to incite. Harmonic ratios, metrical proportions,
verbal rhetoric---all of these must align, but they were still not enough
without the fourth condition, the disposition of the hearer. The listener must
have a humoral temperament that is moved in the desired way by the music.  

This means that the tension between acccommodating hearing and training it is
multiplied vastly by the addition of music. While it might seem that music would
allow for greater accommodation, the number of potential obstacles is increased
because the content of the music, the performance, and the listeners must all be
in harmony. When Kircher compares music to preaching, he says that an effective
preacher is familiar with his audience and therefore "knows which strings to
pluck"---a phrase that recalls Antonio de Azevedo's image of the religious
teacher with harp in hand
[@Kircher:Musurgia, 551: "Nouerat enim prædicator fuorum auditorum
inclinationem; nouerat chordam, quam tangere debebat."].
But Kircher never fully resolves the tension between the universal power of
music and the variables of individual subjectivity and cultural conditioning. 

Music could, as Kircher describes, move someone to experience the truth of
religious teaching through affective experience, but only if the listener was
"the sort of man who was devoted to God"---that is, someone who already had
faith, whose temperament was already disposed to religious devotion of this
kind.  If, as Kircher acknowledges, people of different nations are moved by
different kinds of music, and if individual people respond differently depending
on their temperament as well as their intellectual capacity, how could the
creators of sacred music be assured of its power?

Kircher's theory represents one attempt to reconcile the challenges of
accommodating the ear and training it.  But outside the erudite realm of
theoretical speculation, this was a problem that faced every Catholic church
leader and musician who was serious about using music to make faith appeal to
hearing. How could the Church use music to accommodate hearing, when individuals
and communities did not hear the same way? The capacity to listen faithfully,
and therefore music's power to make faith appeal to hearing, would be limited by
both personal subjectivity and cultural conditioning, and these limitations
created anxiety and fear about the role of hearing in faith.
