\chapter{Offering and Imitation (Zaragoza, 1650--1700)}
\label{ch:zaragoza}

%{{{1 intro
Villancicos about music challenged composers to use the craft of music to
communicate theological ideas about music itself, and they presented listeners
with the opportunity to listen for higher forms of music through the lower form
of music they could hear---provided listeners were equipped with the requisite
musical, poetic, and religious knowledge and aural training to interpret them.
The practice of imitation was central to this tradition in several senses. 
In the sense of Neoplatonic theology, Spanish musicians were imitating heavenly
harmony in earthly music, though we have seen that their creations manifest a
complex and nuanced reflection on the links between different levels of music
both human, celestial, and divine.

Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla and Joan Cererols both used topical references to
different types of human music to help listeners rethink the relationship
between human and divine, especially in the Incarnation of Jesus celebrated in
the Christmas feast.
Gutiérrez de Padilla sets poetic words about music to actual musical figures at
such a literal level of text-setting, even to the level of puns, that he has the
chorus discussing its own music-making, as it is happening: such as when one
choir admonishes the other to count while that choir is counting, or most
notably when the ensemble sings the phrase \term{a la mi re} on a series of
pitches that put that note and notes with those solmization syllables into the
mouths of the choir even as they are pronouncing them.
This is all the more meaningful given the theological background of that piece,
which celebrates Christ as the \term{Verbum infans}, the unspeaking/infant Word
who embodies God's communication to humanity and whose wordless cries give
utterance not to words but to the divine-and-human nature of the Word himself.
Joan Cererols is focused less on imitating celestial music than on using worldly
music to point beyond itself to that higher music of the \term{Verbum infans}.
By creating a musical-rhetorical contrast between dissonant, expressive music
and relatively sober music in classical counterpoint, Cererols imitates the
discord between worldly music generally, including the imperfect music of the
spheres, and the true harmony of the divine as heard in the new song of the
Incarnate Christ.
Dissonance serves Cererols as an ironic symbol that points to a truth by
enacting its opposite, but this symbolism is still a form of imitation in the
Neoplatonic sense---in fact it may be heard as a sophisticated discourse
\emph{about} imitation itself.

Both composers also employ imitation in a less overtly theological sense as
well, as they created their villancicos within traditions of metamusical
composition among networks of teachers, colleagues, and rivals. 
The poets and compositors of these families of villancico texts cultivated
conventional ways of speaking theologically about music (while also playing
against these conventions), and the composers developed tropes of metamusical
representation that, aside from the lofty goals just described, also functioned
to establish a pedigree for these musicians.

This chapter concludes the trajectory traced in \cref{part:unhearable-music} by
focusing on the changing nature of imitation within a network of composers in
the province of Zaragoza.
We have already seen more than once that Zaragoza was a principal node in the
network of villancico composers and poets.
The first case study in this chapter examines two successive settings of the
same textual family by Pablo Bruna and Miguel Ambiela.
Unlike the cases of Gutiérrez de Padilla and Cererols, where lost
musical settings are unavailable for comparison, here we have a clear case of a
younger composer imitating the work of a respected musician of the preceding
generation---not only using the same words but adapting some of the same musical
ideas as well.
Detailed analysis reveals that Ambiela is both expressing similarity to Bruna
while also articulating differences that only take on their full significance
through comparison.
Jus as with Cererols's heavenly dissonance, both the demonstration of similarity
and of difference constitute aspects of imitation.
To play on the saying about imitation and flattery, expressing similarity may be
the the sincerest form of imitation, but signaling difference may constitute an
even higher form.
The contrast between treatments of the same source demonstrates how musical
representations of heavenly music, and the theological worldview that motivated
those representations, were changing.  

The final section discusses the villancico \wtitle{Qué música divina} by José de
Cáseda of Zaragoza, preserved in a convent collection from Puebla, in which the
conventions of the metamusical villancico tradition are pushed to a particular
extreme.
The increasing weight of convention in this type of music required composers to
devise ever-new ways to represent the relationship between heavenly and earthly
music.
Here Christ is compared to a \term{vihuela}, the Spanish plucked-string
instrument related to the guitar.
The theological significance of the metaphor depends on details of the
instrument's construction and tuning, and the musical structure actually works
to express the nature of the instrument through the singers' voices.
The composer appears to be intentionally asking the vocalists to perform
\quoted{false} or \quoted{wrong} music in order to convey the imperfection of
human music as well as to evoke the suffering of Christ.

These acts of imitation are also acts of offering: in an individual aspect, each
composer in a tradition of homage and imitation is offering a new piece as a
tribute to teachers and paragons; in a communal aspect, these pieces served as
offerings to communities of worship, through which members of those communities
offered themselves in devotion. 
Unlike the Christmas pieces in the previous case studies, the pieces in this
chapter are for devotion to the Eucharist (Bruna and Cáseda) and to Mary
(Ambiela).  
In keeping with their ritual functions, their poetic themes---voices rising to
heaven like flames from a soul burning with love like a phoenix (Bruna/Ambiela),
Christ's suffering on the cross as a musical performance---present music as an
affective devotional practice of self-offering.

\section{Voices as Flames of Self-Offering: 
\wtitle{Suban las voces al cielo} by Pablo Bruna}

%{{{2 bruna background, function
Zaragoza was an important religious center in the crown of Aragon, with its two
principle churches, the cathedral of La Seo and the basilica of El Pilar (today
co-cathedrals).  
A large proportion of the surviving villancico poetry imprints were published in
Zaragoza, many of them commemorating performances of music by Diego de Cáseda or
his son José.
In the greater province of Zaragoza, the village of Daroca was home to the
acclaimed blind organist Pablo Bruna.  
Miguel Ambiela, from the same province, received his early training in Daroca
before graduating to highly prestigious posts in Zaragoza, Madrid, and Toledo.

The first known version of \wtitle{Suban las voces al cielo} is a Eucharistic
villancico composed by Pablo Bruna for four voices (SSAT) with accompaniment,
preserved in the archive of Girona Cathedral.%
    \citXXX[signature]
The musicologist Pedro Calahorra identified Miguel Ambiela's piece of the same
incipit and edited both scores in 1986, with a comparative analysis.
Calahorra described Ambiela's \wtitle{Suban las voces} as a \quoted{parody
villancico}, calling it \quoted{an homage from a pupil to his master}.%
    \Autocite[9]{Calahorra:Suban}
Calahorra briefly analyzes the pieces' formal structures and situates them
within a history of musical style, with focus on a distinction between
Renaissance and Baroque aesthetics.

The similarities in the poetry and music between the versions by Bruna and
Ambiela do suggest that Ambiela knew Bruna's villancico and composed his
villancico as an intentional response to it.
But there is more to learn here, both on musical and theological levels, not
least because of a newly discovered source of the Bruna villancico, previously
unattributed, in the Catalan state library (\sig{E-BBc}{M/759/44}).
The music and words of the estribillo in this second manuscript are identical to
the Girona version, but the coplas differ.  
Both manuscripts have the same music for the coplas, but distinct poetic texts.

\wtitle{Suban las voces} is the only surviving villancico attributed to Pablo
Bruna.
Bruna was born in 1611 in Daroca, a small town about 93 km southwest of
Zaragoza.
He served as organist at the collegiate church of Santa María de los Sagrados
Corporales from 1631 until his death in 1679.%
	\Autocite[104]{Calahorra:Aragon}
His musicianship, which was not hindered by being blind from an early age, was
renowned throughout the region; in 1639 he was offered the organist position at
El Pilar in Zaragoza but declined it.% 
    \Autocite[123--125]{Calahorra:Aragon}
Bruna's organ music was disseminated more widely through its inclusion in the
anthology \wtitle{Huerto ameno de varias flores de música} collected by Fray
Antonio Martín y Coll and published in Madrid in 1709.

The watermark and appearance of the Barcelona manuscript suggests a copying date
in the last third of the seventeenth century, but the style of the music
suggests a much earlier date of composition.  
Bruna's madrigalesque counterpoint for four voices is similar to other such
pieces from before 1660, in contrast to the solo and duo continuo-songs that
predominate later.%
\begin{Footnote}
    The Girona manuscript does include an accompaniment part labeled
    \foreign{entablatura}, but this is primarily a \term{basso seguente} rather
    than the independent continuo part found in Irízar and Carrión.
\end{Footnote}
The musical style is actually rather similar to that of Gutiérrez de Padilla. 
Though Bruna was a generation younger, most of Padilla's villancicos are from
the last decades of his life, so the two were composing at the same time.

Bruna's villancico would function well for Eucharistic devotion, in both its
poetic content and musical style.  
The piece fits a subtype of chamber villancico dedicated \foreign{al Santísimo
Sacramento} (to the Blessed Sacrament) and intended not for the extravert public
festivities of Corpus Christi, but for more reflective and intimate occasions of
Eucharistic adoration.
This more intimate type of Eucharistic villancico frequently features
mystically-infused texts with an emphasis on personal affective devotion to
Christ in the sacrament.  

The central image in Bruna's villancico is the soul as a burning phoenix,
consumed by the love of God.
This use of fire symbolism may be found in other Eucharistic villancicos, such
as a 1643 piece by Jaume Pexa from Lleida (Lérida)
(\cref{poem:Que_me_quemo-Pexa}), with estribillo similar to Bruna's.%
\begin{Footnote}
    \sig{E-Bbc}{M/765/15}; see \shortcite[\sv{Pexa, Jaume}]{DMEH}.
    The manuscript is in the same box of villancicos as the Barcelona version of
    Cererols's \wtitle{Suspended, cielos}, as well as a piece by Miguel Ambiela
    and another by one of the Cásedas (probably Diego, the elder).  
    This suggests that music of all these composers was valued by the same
    collector, whether individual or institutional.
\end{Footnote}
The partbooks of Pexa's eight-voice piece bear the heading \foreign{De amores
del exposo sancto} (About love for the exposed Sacrament)---making clear that
the piece was to be performed for Eucharistic adoration.

\subsection{Hearing the Burning Heart}

The anonymous poet of Bruna's villancico combines the conceit of the soul as a
burning phoenix with a musical conceit announced in the first line: \quoted{Let
voices to ascend to heaven} (\cref{poem:Suban_las_voces-Bruna-estribillo,
poem:Suban_las_voces-Bruna-coplas}).
As a poem, the estribillo of \wtitle{Suban las voces} may be divided into three
sections. 
First, the opening quatrain (\poemlines{1--4}) establishes the primary conceit;
second, \poemlines{5--11} present a scene of music-making using technical terms
from music; and third, the estribillo closes with a couplet (\poemlines{12--13})
that epitomizes the conceit.
These sections are articulated through the poetic-metrical structure, with the
first section in octosyllables (suggesting \term{romance}), the second in
seven-syllable \term{romancillo}, and an irregular closing couplet.
Lines 4 and 13, both truncated to five syllables, mark ending points in the
text; and assonance throughout unifies the poem.

This pattern is generally similar to the form of \wtitle{Voces, las de la
capilla}, though shorter and without a \term{respuesta} section.  
The second section of \wtitle{Suban}, \quoted{Y mudando el aire en veloces
corcheas}, is quite similar to the estribillo of \wtitle{Voces}, which begins
\quoted{Y a trechos las distancias en uno y otro coro} (and in the musical
setting, features \term{corcheas} for the first time).
Further, the concluding summary couplet is similar in function to the one at the
end of the \wtitle{Voces} estribillo, \quoted{Todo en el hombre es subir}.
These connections situate Bruna's text as part of an older poetic tradition,
though not necessarily linking it directly with \wtitle{Voces}.

{\wtitle{Suban las voces}, setting I, poetic text set by Bruna, coplas}
%}}}4

As in the other villancico families in \cref{part:unhearable-music}, the poem
exists in variant forms; in this case the coplas differ between the Girona and
Barcelona manuscripts.
The first copla is identical in both sources, but the Girona version follows it
with two stanzas, while the Barcelona version follows it with five unique
stanzas.
The Barcelona coplas all follow the same metrical scheme as copla 1: three
octosyllablic lines and the refrain \foreign{arde}, with \emph{a/e} assonance
the even lines.
The Girona coplas, by contrast, change the metrical pattern after copla 1: they
add an additional line and maintain assonance only in the last syllables; the
\foreign{arde} refrain no longer forms part of the metrical structure.
These differences suggest that the Barcelona coplas are closer to the original
source of this textual family, while the different Girona coplas were likely
penned by a later poet, possibly to replace verses that had been lost or
forgotten.
The theology and tone of the texts also suggests that the Barcelona source is
older, as the Girona coplas are slightly more didactic.
As was the case with the Jalón's \wtitle{Cantores de la capilla}
(\cref{ch:padilla-voces}) and with the revised textual family B of
\wtitle{Suspended, cielos} (\cref{ch:cererols-suspended}), the more simplified,
explanatory texts in a villancico tradition are often the later ones, suggesting
the accommodation of an earlier text to suit later tastes.

Similar to Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, Bruna sets each phrase of poetic text to a
distinct phrase of music, with its own rhythmic and harmonic profile, following
closely the prosody of the words.  
The three poetic sections are also clearly articulated in the musical form
through shifts of meter and character.
Bruna has his musicians enact the musical concepts in the poem in a
madrigalistic manner.  
The singers perform \quoted{let voices ascend} by leaping upward on
\quoted{voces} (\measures{1--4}) and then repeating the whole phrase again a
third higher---a musical-rhetorical \term{anaphora}, since the term means both
repeating a phrase and \quoted{lifting up}.
Bruna follows the first section with a change of meter (to \meterC), and his
setting of \quoted{Y mudando el aire en veloces corcheas} uses appropriately
flying \foreign{corcheas} (eighth notes), ascending and descending in pairs
(\foreign{juntas}) (\cref{mux:Bruna-Suban_las_voces-estribillo}).
Bruna sets \quoted{en síncopas que elevan} exactly as would be expected, with
syncopated phrases that leap upwards like flames.
Bruna uses chromatic alterations for the phrase \quoted{bemoles blandos},
writing E flats in the outer voices (\measures{21}) and then setting up a
striking Phrygian cadence in \measures{21--22} in which the Alto leaps upwards
into an unprepared seventh.  
Bruna writes dotted figures on \quoted{trinados que suspendan} that would invite
any singer to add a trill, and in \measures{26--28}, these trills flow into
textbook suspensions (as in \measures{27}, Alto).
For \foreign{digan en paso} (let them say in turn) Bruna has the voices follow
each other in fugal imitation, in an evenly paced rhythmic pattern.

%}}}4

In the coplas Bruna breaks up the declamation-focused setting with a syncopated
rhythm on \foreign{si en Dios hallas nueva vida} (if you find new life in God):
by dividing three measures (\term{compases}) of duple time into what sounds like
four measures of triple, he animates this phrase with a new kind of rhythmic
life (\cref{mux:Bruna-Suban_las_voces-coplas}).
Similarly, in the ending refrain line on \foreign{arde}, Bruna syncopates the
rhythm by playing off the voices in pairs, where in each measure one group has
downbeat accents and the other has a minim rest followed by an offbeat accent.
Cerone calls rests \foreign{sospiros}, literally \quoted{sighs}, and their use
here creates a breathless intensity that fittingly portrays the soul in ardor.%
    \citXXX[Cerone]

This passage points to a more dramatic quality of Bruna's setting that goes
beyond literal representations of the musical figures in the poetry to create a
mystical affect, partly through the use of chromaticism.
For example, in \measure{7}, the voice and accompaniment undulate between a
G-over-E\fl{} harmony and F\sh-over-D, on the words \quoted{a phoenix is
burning, a soul}.
These minor-second gestures and chromatic alterations may be
ways of characterizing spiritual passion.
Altered notes could symbolize the changes wrought by fire, which in turn is a
metaphor for the soul's conversion to loving God.  
Beyond the symbolic level, such gestures seem to form part of a stylistic topic
connected with a certain kind of worship experience.  
The piece both depicts affective devotion and actually serves as a form of
affective devotion for its historic performers and their worshipping community.

Voices Rising in Intercession: 
\wtitle{Suban las voces al cielo} by Miguel Ambiela
}


The second villancico beginning \wtitle{Suban las voces al cielo}, by Miguel Ambiela, is based on the same poetic text set by Bruna, and probably on Bruna's music as well.
The new poem is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and retains none of the fire or phoenix symbolism of Bruna's villancico.
The compositor of Ambiela's poetic text (likely Ambiela himself) has simply excerpted from the Bruna poem all the lines with musical vocabulary and built a new poem around them (\cref{poem:Suban-2-estribillo}).

% 	\input{poems/Suban-2-estribillo}
% \end{expoem}
% %********************

Miguel Ambiela (1666--1733), like his contemporary Jerónimo de Carrión, lived through the end of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty, the ensuing War of Spanish Succession, and the installment of the new Bourbon dynasty.
His highly successful career spanned a tremendous shift not only in political life, but also in religious sensibilities and musical aesthetics.
Raised in La Puebla de Albortón in Zaragoza provice, his parents sent him at age 15 (in 1681) to study music in Daroca.
Since Bruna had died three years earlier, Pedro Calahorra's claim that Ambiela was Bruna's student cannot be true.
Nevertheless, it is probable that Bruna's music was still being performed during Ambiela's apprenticeship, and that Ambiela himself participated in the performances.
Only four years later Ambiela was appointed chapelmaster at the collegiate church.
During the single year he served there (1685--1686), Ambiela would have made use of the church's archive, where he could have encountered Bruna's villancico if he had not already heard or performed it. 
His first position after Daroca was in Lleida (1686--1690), followed by one in Jaca (1698--1700).
After this he ascended to some of the most prestigious positions in Spain: El Pilar in Zaragoza (1700--1707), Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid (1707--1710), and finally Toledo Cathedral (1710--1733).%
	%
	\autocites[1]{Calahorra:Suban}[\sv{Ambiela}]{Grove}{Alvarez:Ambiela}
	%

The manuscript of Ambiela's \wtitle{Suban las voces} for six voices (SST, SAT, Ac.), preserved in Barcelona (E-Bbc:~M/733/1) was composed sometime before 1689, probably while Ambiela was still in Daroca.
The title page dedicates the piece for the Assumption of Mary.
A second, sloppier hand on the title page is probably that of a young performer who doodled with his own name (\quoted{Torrente}) at the bottom of the page and who also copied his own bajón part.
This writer ascribes the piece to \quoted{Master Miguel Ambiela, who was from Lérida and before that from Daroca, where the wall is big and the city is small}.%
	%
	\footnote{%
\foreign{Del Maestro Miguel Ambiela/ q[ue] fue de Lerida y despues de daroca en donde el muro/ es Grande y la Ciutat es Poca}
	}
	%
The same hand has written at the top of the accompaniment part:  \quoted{Acompa[ñamien]to Continuo a 6 Vozes del Maestro Miguel Ambiela año 1689 a 24 8ºre}, thus specifying the date as October 24, 1689---an unusual level of specificity.

The date in the manuscript is more likely the date of copying than a performance or composition date.
October 24, 1689 was the feast of St. Raphael, Archangel, but the villancico is clearly intended for the Assumption of the Virgin on August 15.
In any case, the date provides a \term{terminus ante quem} for the composition of this villancico.

In 1689 the 23-year-old Ambiela was chapelmaster in Lleida (Lérida in Castilian), halfway between Zaragoza and Barcelona.
The final obstruent devoicing in the copyist's phonetic spelling \quoted{ciutat} for \quoted{ciudad} suggests he spoke Catalan, which makes sense if he was a member of Ambiela's chapel in Lleida.
The joke disparaging Daroca (a small town surrounded with huge medieval walls) also suggests the copyist was in a larger, more prestigious city.
It is notable that the copyist points out Ambiela's previous position in Daroca, given the work's connection with Pablo Bruna.

%************************************************************
\subsection{Imitation and Homage}

Calahorra sees a \quoted{great similarity} between Ambiela's setting and that of Bruna, but it would be better to think of Ambiela's piece as an homage rather than a parody.
	%
	\autocite[18]{Calahorra:Suban}
	%
Obviously, both pieces begin with four voices in an upward-leaping gesture high in their tessituras.
Both composers set the words \quoted{Suban las voces al cielo} as a musical phrase three compases (nine minims) long.
Bruna, in his work for a single chorus, accomplishes \term{anaphora} by repeating this first phrase transposed up a third.
Ambiela does Bruna one better with his stretto entrance of the second chorus, as though he has taken Bruna's two opening phrases and superimposed them.
Next in Bruna's setting (Bruna \measures{6--9}), a solo voice sings the beginning of the phrase and the full chorus joins for the end. 
Ambiela again expands on Bruna's approach for his second phrase (Ambiela \measures{3--9}): he begins not with a single voice but with two, and then expands these into a fugato.

Ambiela begins the next section with a motive identical to one used by Bruna: Ambiela \measures{10} (F--E--D--C\sh--D--C\sh); Bruna \measures{6} (B\fl--A--G--F\sh--G--F\sh).
Like the similar passage in Bruna, Ambiela writes this motive for highest voice with only continuo accompaniment (\cref{ex:Ambiela-Suban_las_voces-mudando}).
As Calahorra points out, Ambiela follows Bruna in switching to C meter for the \quoted{mudando el aire} passage (with the same symbolism of \quoted{changing}), and in using an imitative texture in \quoted{flying corcheas}, moving \quoted{together} in pairs of voices.%
	%
	\footnote{%
Ambiela's fugato in \measures{11--16} is also strikingly similar to the fugato in Cererols \wtitle{Suspended cielos}, because Ambiela's subject begins with the same descending fifth from A to D that Cererols used, and Ambiela uses many of the same contrapuntal techniques (such as the inversion in \measures{12}, Ti. II).
	}
	%
Like Bruna, Ambiela also uses the predictable syncopated figures where the text requires it, though in distinction to Bruna he introduces this line of text while the one before it is still being repeated, creating a rich texture of flying eighth-notes and syncopated figures in tension with each other.
And in the last section, like Bruna, Ambiela illustrates \quoted{pasos} with imitative counterpoint, though his double fugato is considerably expanded compared to the short passage in Bruna.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	The Calahorra edition misplaces one of the fugal entries by two compases.

% \end{example}
% %*******************

These connections suggest strongly that Ambiela could have known Bruna's piece.
It is very likely Ambiela had access to Bruna's score or even performed it.
Whoever provided Ambiela's poetic text, if not Ambiela himself, certainly knew the other text and deliberately adapted it for a new purpose.
The surviving manuscript lesson books from apprentice musicians in seventeenth-century Spain demonstrate that students did learn by copying older examples. 
One such notebook (E-Bbc:~M/732/15), written in Catalan, concludes with a section on \quoted{Some Rules about Counterpoint observed from the Method of Some Masters in Girona}.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	\foreign{Algunas Reglas sobre els Contrapunts observadas del metodo de alguns mestres en Gerona}.
	}
	%
The notes appear to represent lessons learned not from a course of theory training, but from studying manuscripts in the archive.

Even aside from the direct connection to Daroca, the two composers appear to have been part of the same network of composers we have been tracing, or at least their works were collected by those who valued composers within that network.
Copies of both Bruna and Ambiela villancicos are present in the Biblioteca de Catalunya's collection.
Though the two settings of \wtitle{Suban las voces} are not now in the same archival signature (that is, they are in different boxes of villancicos), each piece is gathered with pieces by some of the same composers.
These composers include most notably Joan Cererols and one of the Cásedas (probably the elder, Diego), including a setting by Cáseda of a text also set by Cererols, \wtitle{Pues que para la sepultura}.
It seems possible that Ambiela was acquainted with Cererols personally, if not only by reputation; and it is almost certain that he knew one or both Cásedas in Zaragoza, since he succeeded their successive tenures as chapelmaster of El Pilar.
Ambiela was also connected to Madrid composers from at least the time of his position at Las Descalzas; indeed immediately adjacent to Ambiela's \wtitle{Suban las voces} in E-Bbc: M/733 is a villancico by the influential Madrid composer Sebastián Durón along with works by Carlos Patiño.

On the other hand, aside from the opening and the motivic similarity, many of the similarities between pieces could be explained simply as two composers setting the same words according to similar musical-rhetorical conventions.
The poetry includes highly specific references to musical practice that demand a certain setting in music.
Most of the similarities between settings are structural or procedural, rather than being on the level of quotation or literal adaptation.
In fact the two pieces differ strongly in character.
In contrast to Bruna's intimate, chamber-style piece in mystically tinged \term{cantus mollis}, Ambiela's villancico is a large-scale polychoral piece in a public, celebratory manner, set in mode 9 (the authentic mode with an A final).

Paradoxically, though, it is actually in the ostensible differences between the settings where it becomes clearest that the piece probably is an homage.
Ambiela takes Bruna's model, and expands it and increases its complexity in every way he can.
Since any Spanish composer would have, for example, set \foreign{bemoles blandos} (mild flats) with added flats, it is all the more striking when Ambiela breaks with the expected.
For \foreign{bemoles blandos}, Ambiela does not write a single flat (\cref{ex:Ambiela-Suban_las_voces-bemoles}); in fact, he writes an extended passage loaded with sharps.
For \quoted{trinados que suspendan}, Ambiela does not write the classical suspensions that Bruna does (which by rule always resolved downward by step). 
Instead he writes an chromatic line that does nothing but ascends (\measures{27--29}, Ti. I-2).
The flats and classic suspensions only come after this passage, on \quoted{sigan sus pasos} (\measures{33}); but the added B flats are constantly juxtaposed against F sharps.%

	\footnote{%
	Ambiela's unique treatment of the repeat of the estribillo after the coplas deserves to be noted.
Each copla is sung by a soloist and then leads into a repeat, not of the whole estribillo, but only of a portion.
The first copla leads into a repeat of the opening section (\measures{1--9}); the second copla, into the middle section (\measures{10--25}), and the last copla, into the concluding section (\measures{25--67}).

Why, when Ambiela sets the rest of the text so literally, would he resist the impulse to write flats on \quoted{bemoles} and descending suspensions on \quoted{suspendan}?
One explanation is that Ambiela made these choices deliberately in response to Bruna's setting. 
Bruna did the obvious thing and used flats; to outdo his model Ambiela had to illustrate the idea of flats ironically by using sharps. 
Ambiela seems to reflect a different type of confidence in music's power to represent: for Bruna, the mirror-in-a-mirror effect of singing flats while singing about flats was enough; for Ambiela, one must sing sharps. 

Here we see a central theme of the case studies in \cref{part:unhearable-music}: a tradition formed through composerly homage and competition is mapped against changing notions of music's role (and humanity's role) in the cosmos. 
As Calahorra also observes, Ambiela's free-wheeling or even reckless approach to counterpoint is worlds apart from the more traditional style of Bruna.
Bruna's work is relatively intimate, subtle, contemplative; Ambiela's is extroverted, exuberant, even ostentatious.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	Some of this difference, it should be noted, stems from the pieces' differing liturgical functions. 
	One is a chamber piece for Eucharistic devotion whie the other is a calenda-type celebration for one of the highest feasts of the Spanish church year.
	}
	%
For example, in Ambiela's first section in imitative texture, \measures{3--6}, the voices fly past each other almost as though they are not all singing the same piece, creating frequent F\na/C\sh\ sonorities, and for one brief moment (\measures{4}, third minim) only the pitches A, G, and D are sounding.
Calahorra provides an analysis of Ambiela's abruptly shifting cadences and pervasive use of seventh chords on the first beat of the compás.
It is certainly possible that these are the marks of an inexperienced, twenty-three-year-old composer, especially one trying to do something impressive without having yet acheived the technical means to do it well.

But it is also possible that the effect of wild, heedless rejoicing, or of mysterious music that defies earthly rules, is exactly what Ambiela wanted, in line with the Neoplatonic theology seen developing in the other examples of \cref{part:unhearable-music}, but now part of an emerging high-Baroque aesthetic.
The difference may be compared to the distance between \wtitle{Las meninas} of Velázquez (1656), in which the painter paints himself painting; and an extravagant \term{trompe-l'oeil} like the \term{transparente} of Toledo Cathedral---which was completed by Narciso Tomé and his sons only a year before Ambiela's death in 1733.
A decreasing confidence in music's power of representation, of music's faithfulness to the real world, results in a continuously escalating demand for self-conscious artifice.
The emphasis shifts from imitating heavenly music to representing earthly music, and the functional goal of the music, theologically speaking, shifts from a primarily contemplative one toward a more affective, expressive one.

%****************************************
\subsection{Poetic and Theological Themes: Mary in Music}

The poem set by Ambiela is clearly based on that set by Bruna.
The relationship between them is more similar to that between Jalón's \wtitle{Cantores} and Padilla's \wtitle{Voces} (chapter~\ref{ch:Padilla-Voces}) than the different versions of \wtitle{Suspended, cielos} (chapter~\ref{ch:Cererols}).
With \wtitle{Suspended, cielos} all the versions are similar enough to be considered variants of the same poem: some add verses or remove them, some alter a word here or there, but the basic structure and hematic content remain the same. 
The Jalón and Padilla villancicos, by contrast, are clearly derived from the same textual tradition, but are distinct poems with different poetic conceits and literary aesthetics.

There is an even greater contrast between Ambiela's villancico and Bruna.
Bruna's theme was the Eucharist as a site for mystical communion between the ardent soul and an all-consuming God.
Ambiela's theme is the Assumption of the Virgin Mary into heaven.
The underlined phrases in table~\ref{table:Bruna-Ambiela-cf} are those taken from Bruna's setting, but it should be clear how different the new context is from the original.

% %********************
% \begin{table}
% 	\caption{\wtitle{Suban las voces}, Comparison of estribillos set by Bruna and Ambiela}
% 	\label{table:Bruna-Ambiela-cf}
% 	\input{tables/Bruna-Ambiela-cf}
% \end{table}
% %********************	

The musical references in Bruna's poem are now put to a new ritual function.
Rather than drawing a comparison between the transformative power of fire and that of music, now music's power to \quoted{transform the air} is connected to the Blessed Virgin's translation from the realm of earth to that of Heaven.
\quoted{Cielo} here primarily means \quoted{cielo Empyreo}, God's Heaven: this is the singular \quoted{esfera} where Mary will enjoy eternal glories.
All the same, Mary must pass through the worldly domain of the sky in order to be assumed into the sphere beyond the physical realm.
And it is in that wordly sphere of air that human \term{musica instrumentalis} can resound in praise of Mary and in imitation of her miraculous transformation.

For Catholic devotion, The miracle of Mary's assumption was that, as the villancico says, she remained \quoted{entera}---her body and soul were not separated as those of other humans are at death, but rather ascend to heaven integral and whole.
Mary at her death remains \quoted{intact} not only as a perpetual virgin but as a human body and soul in perfect harmony.
Indeed, not only is Mary transformed from a mortal woman to an eternally living heavenly saint, in her new domain she is crowned as Queen of Heaven, as she was praised in the ubiquitous \wtitle{Salve Regina} chant and many others.
Much of the Assumption liturgy concentrates on Mary's new role as heavenly Queen and intercessor for humanity.

In this way some of the same aspects of musical theology that we have seen in Christmas villancicos and in Bruna's Eucharistic villancico can be applied to Mary.
Instead of music pointing to the harmony between Christ's dual natures, here it points to the unity of Mary's body and soul, not separated in death.
In Catholic devotion, Mary brings together human and divine worlds in harmony as the one who bore God into the world in Christ, and as the first of the saintly intercessors in heaven.
Mary can even be represented as a chapelmaster (as in Sor Juana's villancico \wtitle{Silencio, que canta María}, discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:intro}), leading the song of all the saints.

The villancico connects human music-making to Mary's role as heavenly intercessor.
The coplas depict the world left behind by Mary, which cries out to her in her new role as mediator through voices of music.
The music that thus ascends to heaven follows the path Mary followed: \quoted{sigan sus pasos todos hasta la esfera}.
Thus human music is presented as a form of intercessory prayer, of which Mary is the chapelmaster because she is the chief intercessor among all the saints.
All the other saints follow Mary's example and harmonize with her faith.

Like Bruna's \wtitle{Suban las voces}, then, Ambiela's villancico performs a theology of music as a form of prayer ascending to heaven.
The musical language in Ambiela's poem serves as metaphor both for Mary's immaculate nature and for Mary's role as queen of the saints and principal intercessor.


%************************************************************
\subsection{Voice, Flame, and Phoenix}

The connection between the poem's two conceits---singing voices and the burning phoenix---may not be immediately apparent.
Some of the musical terms (\quoted{corcheas}, \quoted{síncopas}, \quoted{bemoles}) have no obvious theological meaning, and may seem like superfluous excuses for compositional showmanship.
But this poem does not use music as a metaphor for theological concepts the way Padilla's \wtitle{Voces} does.
Instead the musical language refers directly to actual music-making.
The villancico is about the act of devotion through music.

The relationship between the concepts of singing and burning here is closer to analogy than to metaphor.
As flames rise from the burning phoenix, so should the voices rise from souls afire with the love of God.
This linkage is apt because in early modern physics, both fire and music \quoted{transform the air}.
In the physiology of the time, there was also a connection between the physical mechanism of the voice and the element of fire.
By exploring what the symbol of the phoenix meant in Bruna's time, and how fire was understood, this simple connection becomes meaningful for understanding music theologically within early modern cosmology.

%*******************
\subsubsection{The Phoenix as Symbol and Emblem}

The phoenix (\term{fénix}) according to the 1611 Covarrubias dictionary, was \quoted{said to be a singular bird who is born in the Orient, celebrated through all the world, raised in happy Arabia, \Dots{} who lives six hundred and sixty years}.%
    \Autocite[400, \sv{fenix}]{Covarrubias:Tesoro}
Covarrubias cites Pliny along with Tacitus and other Classical authorities for the famous legend of this noble bird that builds its own funeral pyre and is then reborn from the ashes.
The account matches the villancico's description of the phoenix in the coplas, particularly B1/G1, B5, and B6.
Covarrubias recounts another story that this happened in the same year as Christ's crucifixion and resurrection, \quoted{of which it seemed prophetic}.
Be these tales true or false, Covarrubias writes, \quoted{the sentiment is pious, and many have formed hieroglyphics of the phoenix, applying them to the resurrection of our Lord, and more have done so than could be counted, and likewise many emblems and imprints that are moral or deal with amorous subjects. \Dots{} The alchemists have their particular symbols under the name of the phoenix bird}.%
    \Autocite[400]{Covarrubias:Tesoro}
Covarrubias himself had published just such a moral emblem one year previous in his \wtitle{Emblemas morales}.
His emblem 90 combines the heraldic arms of the royal monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, St. Lawrence's grill, with a burning phoenix underneath a sun with rays (\cref{fig:Covarrubias-phoenix}).
    \Autocite[f.~290, r--v]{Covarrubias:Emblemas}
As with all his emblems, Covarrubias matches a mysterious visual image centered on a cryptic motto with a slightly less mysterious poem, all of which he then explains in prose on the next page.
The motto FŒLICITER ARDET is taken from Ovid: \quoted{If someone loves something that gives joy when loved, he burns happily, rejoices, and as by wind sails directly to the beloved}.%
\begin{footnote}
    Ovid, \wtitle{De remedio amoris}, quoted in \autocite[290v]{Covarrubias:Emblemas}: 
    \quoted{Si quis amat, quod amare iubat; fœliciter ardet, Gaudeat, \& vento nauiget ille suo}.
\end{footnote}

Covarrubias's phoenix poem develops similar ideas to the Bruna villancico: a fire of divine love in the human breast, the phoenix dying for love but being transformed to new life.

%********************
\begin{verse}
Always in the mortal breast there burns\\
the celestial, divine, and holy fire;\\ 
it causes no conflict with the elemental body\\
For it causes neither fear nor alarm:\\
as another Phoenix, in love it burns\\
and though it is consumed in its old mantle\\
it changes it for another, more precious---\\
of royal purple, incorruptible, and glorious.
\end{verse}
%********************
%
Note that the phoenix is not directly a symbol of Christ here, but rather, like the Bruna villancico, it represents the soul burning with \quoted{holy fire}, being transformed to new life.
The closest comparison between the Covarrubias poem and the villancico would be in coplas B4--B5.

% \end{figure}
% %****************************************


The Bruna villancico functions like a musical emblem. 
Instead of a visual image, the estribillo conjures an auditory emblem in which sounding music serves a similar purpose. 
The creation of a sonic object of contemplation makes particular sense in the case of Bruna, who was blind.
The opening quatrain and the closing couplet both suggest the visual format of emblems with verbal mottos on banners, such as \quoted{FENIX SE ABRASA UN ALMA} or simply \quoted{ARDE}.

The Covarrubias emblem is only one example of how the phoenix could be used symbolically; for a deeper understanding Covarrubias refers his readers to the \wtitle{Commentaria symbolica} of Antonio Ricciardo.%
	%
	\autocite{Ricciardo:CommentariaSymbolica}
	%
Under \quoted{phoenix} Ricciardo lists sixteen possible meanings of the phoenix in different emblematic configurations.
Three of these meanings aid significantly in understanding the symbolism of this villancico:

%********************
\begin{quoting}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.]
	The phoenix signifies our souls in this bodily pilgrimage.
	Indeed, while we are living here we are far removed from our homeland.
\item[13.]
	A phoenix in the midst of burning flames, with the words, \quoted{Ne pereat} (Let him not perish), signifies a man who in the present life gives himself to be burned up through [bodily] mortification, lest he perish eternally.
\item[15.]
	A phoenix over flames, expanding its wings to the rays of the sun, with these three letters, V. E. V., and with the words, \quoted{Ut uiuat} (Let him live) \Dots{} signifies a man, who puts all his hope in Christ the Lord, the sun of justice, from whom he hopes for renewal of life. 
The fire, then, signifies the Holy Spirit, who should be embraced, who chooses everything that is best [for the man], in order that he might be taken up from earthly heaviness, and live eternally.%
		\Autocite[\sv{Phoenix}, 132--133]{Ricciardo:CommentariaSymbolica}
\end{enumerate}
\end{quoting}
%********************

Bruna's villancico explicitly links the phoenix to the soul (\poemlines{3}), in line with these symbolic interpretations.
Ricciardo's pilgrimage idea (definition 3) appears in copla G3, \foreign{Alma, en el camino estás} (Soul, you are on the road).
The motto \quoted{Ne pereat} recalls the phrase \quoted{no peligras} in copla B3, which concentrates on mortification to avoid the \quoted{flatteries of the wicked}.
The image in definition 15 is rather close to Covarrubias's phoenix emblem, though the motto is different; the inclusion of the sun in both corresponds to copla G3.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	It may be significant that Ricciardo distinguishes between images of the phoenix with and without a sun, since the image of the sun is only included in the Girona coplas.
	This slight change of iconographic reference could be further evidence that the Girona coplas were written by a second, later poet.
	}
	%
Most importantly, Ricciardo's definition 15 matches closely with the theology of Bruna's villancico, in which the soul surrenders its own being (copla B2) to find new life in Christ through a purifying fire. 
Ricciardo compares the rising flames of a fire to the soul's ascent to God, just as the villancico uses \quoted{voices ascending to heaven} as metaphor for both concepts---flames and the soul's elevation.

\subsubsection{%
Early Modern Physics of Fire
}

This theological symbolism should be understood according to the early modern physical theory of fire within the system of four elements.
In another emblem (\term{centuria} I, no. 45), Covarrubias provides a useful epitome of the elemental system as understood in seventeenth-century Spain.

%********************
\begin{verse}
Heaven, fire, air, water, and earth\\
and all this, as much as has been created,\\
Love rules it, Love opens and closes it,\\
in a sweet chain, linked together,\\
and when one or the other wages war,\\
the conquered is always left bettered;\\
for the one is converted into the other,\\
taking life even from death.
\end{verse}
%********************

In Covarrubias's view the system of four elements, though based fundamentally on tension between the elements (\quoted{war}), is kept in balance by the governing power of love.
In his explanation he clarifies that this love is \quoted{God himself}.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	The inclusion of \quoted{el cielo} with the list of four elements probably refers to all of creation beyond the earth's atmosphere---the planetary spheres and the \quoted{world beyond} of the \term{cielo Empyreo}. 
	Similarly, after discussing the sun, moon, and stars, Fray Luis writes, \quoted{Now it is time that we descend from Heaven (\quoted{el cielo}) to this lower world, where the four elements reside}
        (\autocite[204]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}).
	}
	%
Divine love, he explains, keeps all the elements together in a continuous chain, transforming one into another to the mutual benefit of all.

The key point here for understanding the symbolism of fire is that the elements are in continual conversion from one to another, and that love is at the center of this movement.
Similarly, Fray Luis de Granda wrote that the Creator built the terrestrial world with its four elements \quoted{by such order and measure [compás] that, though they are opposed to one another, they have peace and harmony [concordia], and not only do they not disturb the world, but in fact they preserve and sustain it}.%
	%
	\autocite[204]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}
	%
Much like Covarrubias's concept of a chain, the four elements are linked with their neighbors in a \quoted{lineage of affinity and genealogy}, such that each passes into the next.
Starting from the lowest of the elements, earth, up through air, water, and the highest, fire, the elements \quoted{do something like a saber dance [danza de espadas], each one continuing on amicably to the others in this way}.

Covarrubias's emblem is in full agreement with the cosmology of Fray Luis.
The friar's last sentence makes essentially the same point as the Covarrubias emblem: that the elements may seem to be at war, but, like the circular bands in the emblem, they are really moving in a round dance united by love.

It is notable how frequently Fray Luis uses musical language to describe the order of nature: \term{compás}, \term{concordia}, and most interestingly, \term{danza de espadas}, which was apparently exactly what it sounds like, a mock-war dance with swords.
Instrumental music for such dances survives from all over the Hispanic world.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	For example, in \autocite{MartinyColl:HuertoAmeno}, and the Peruvian Codex Martínez Compañon.
	}
	%
Fray Luis sees the natural order of the elements reflected in the circular movements of dance (and presumably hears them in the cyclical sonic patterns of dance music as well).
This point should be borne in mind when we return to the connection between fire and music below.

Fire in this cosmology is the highest and lightest of the elements, and therefore the closest to the world beyond the terrestrial.
The air is next to fire in the chain of being.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	The question of why flames rise and other such matters are treated at length in Aristotle's \wtitle{Physics}, which was one of the primary Classical sources for early modern cosmology.
	Helen Lang (\headlesscite{Lang:AristotleMedieval}) analyzes Aristotle's theories and how they were transmitted and transformed through the medieval period.
	}
	%
As Fray Luis later explains, the element of air in the atmosphere is divided into three regions, the highest of which is \quoted{adjacent to the element of fire, and is therefore extremely hot}.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	\autocite[207]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}.
	Fray Luis does not explain this point further, but it may be presumed that the fiery realm beyond this highest region would be the realm of the sun and stars, which Fray Luis understands to be giant balls of fire.
	}
	%
Since the elements are adjacent, the lower one may be transformed into the higher one: thus \quoted{we see the air become inflamed with fire, which is adjacent, and be converted into fire}.%
	%
	\autocite[205]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}
	%
The process of burning, then, converts air into fire through the medium of flame.
As the element at the farthest extreme of the terrestrial realm, and as an agent of transformation in a world governed by love, fire could become an apt symbol for love's ability to transform the soul and transport it into the heavenly realm.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	The transformative power of fire explains the use of the phoenix by the alchemists, as noted by both Covarrubias and Ricciardo.
	It should be noted that fire had many symbolic meanings.
	Covarrubias uses it in about a dozen other emblems.
	In some it is a symbol of love and transformation. 
        The second emblem, of the Eucharist---the \foreign{sine qua non} of transformation through love---features the chalice and host flanked by two flaming braziers, all within a sun with flaming rays.
	Emblem 63 shows a heart pierced with arrows burning in a fiery furnace, representing the pain of love; this resembles the image in Bruna's villancico of the burning heart, dying for love.
	In other emblems Covarrubias also uses fire as a moral symbol with a more negative valence, representing avarice, war, and uncontrolled passions.
	}

%*******************
\subsubsection{Flames of the Soul in St. John of the Cross}

This type of fire symbolism is a common trope of mystical literature, and the classic treatment of the subject is the \wtitle{Llama de amor viva} (Living Flame of Love) by St. John of the Cross.
The Carmelite reformer (known in Spanish as San Juan de la Cruz) wrote this treatise in Granada in about 1582, and it was published with his other works in Madrid in 1630.
John's writings illuminate the metaphor of fire for the soul's rebirth through acts of loving devotion.

The \wtitle{Llama de amor viva} is a poem followed by a treatise on affective devotion in the form of a commentary on the poem.
In the poem, the soul professes its rapturous love for \quoted{the living flame of love} with which the soul is burning, as can be seen in the first six lines (\cref{poem:John-Llama-opening}).
The Bruna villancico, like the piece by Jaume Pexa cited earlier, manifests the same basic trope of the soul burning with love for God, and even being consumed by this fire like the phoenix.
Though John's writings did not have as wide a reception in the seventeenth century as those of his mentor Teresa of Ávila, the published edition can be found in collections on both sides of the Atlantic.
It seems plausible that a mid-seventeenth-century poet writing about the burning soul would have had some familiarity with John's writings or his general theological emphasis, since John treats this particular theme with such intensity.
By reading these texts together we can gain a deeper understanding of how, in early modern Spanish thought, fire could serve as a symbol for the soul being transformed by God.

% \end{expoem}
% %********************

The imagery of the burning soul in Bruna's villancico fits well with the theology of divine union as John expresses it in the \wtitle{Llama}.
John uses fire to represent the soul's purification and transformation, while he uses the flames that rise from the fire to represent the holy acts that proceed from a soul that has been thus purged and renewed.
\quoted{This flame of love}, John writes, \quoted{is the spirit of [the soul's] Bridegroom, who is the Holy Spirit; and the soul indeed feels this flame within herself, not only as a fire which holds her consumed and transformed in tender love, but even as a fire that, beyond this, burns [arde] in her and gives forth a flame}.%
	\Autocite[790]{JuandelaCruz:Llama}
The Holy Spirit works within \quoted{the soul tranformed in love} (or \emph{into} love), bringing about a union of wills between the lover and the object of love.

This image must be understood in the broader context of John's theology of divine union, which he articulated thoroughly in his earlier treatise, the \wtitle{Subida del monte Carmelo} (The Ascent of Mount Carmel).%
In order to achieve \quoted{divine union}, John teaches, the soul must be purged of all sensory appetites and all ideas of God that are less than the inconceivable darkness of God's true self.
Fire is thus an apt metaphor for this process of purgation and transformation.
As the soul is being thus transformed, it gives forth \quoted{flames}, which are the soul's acts of love for God.
\quoted{The difference between the habit and the act}, John explains in the \wtitle{Llama}, \quoted{is that between the transformation in love and the flame of love; that is, the difference between the burning wood and the flame that comes from it; for the flame is the effect of the fire that is there}.%
	\Autocite[790]{JuandelaCruz:Llama}

The flames rising from the fire, then, are the actions of person whose soul is united with God.
John emphasizes that the acts, or effects, of love he has in mind are purely the result of the Holy Spirit working through the soul.
The soul in such a state of \quoted{divine union} is united with God not in nature (the soul does not become God) but in will, so that to the degree possible in mortal life, the soul becomes completely submitted to the divine will and \quoted{remains transformed into God through love}.%
	\Autocite[227]{JuandelaCruz:Subida}
God can then act through the devotee such that the person's actions, though human, appear divine---this the goal of all John's spiritual disciplines.%
	\Autocite[226--230]{JuandelaCruz:Subida}
In other words, the soul that burns in loving union with God in John's system achieves ethical or moral transformation by means of an affective transformation. 
John epitomizes his own mystical theology in these two sentences of the \wtitle{Llama}:
\begin{quoting}
And thus, in this state the soul can perform no acts; for the Holy Spirit does them all, and moves her to them all; and for this reason, all of her acts are divine, for she is made and moved by God. 
From thence it seems to the soul that, each time this flame flickers up, making her to love with savour and divine temper [temple], the flame is giving her eternal life, for it lifts her up, through the working of God, into God.%
	\Autocite[791]{JuandelaCruz:Llama}
\end{quoting}

John's fire metaphor for the process of sanctification and glorification (to use the doctrinal terms) depends on early modern physical explanations of fire.
In explaining his verse about the fire wounding the soul \quoted{in the deepest center}, John draws on a prescientific theory of gravitation to explain that all elements tend toward the center of that element.%
	\Autocite[792--795]{JuandelaCruz:Llama}
Thus stones are pulled down because they seek the center of the earth.
Fire, therefore, ascends because the realm of fire is beyond the sky.
The center of the soul for John is God, and thus the soul is drawn to God like an ascending flame.

In John's theology of divine union, then, the flames that arise from a soul afire with love of God are a person's acts of love and devotion.
People offer these acts as part of offering themselves wholly to God like a burnt offering---like the phoenix immolating itself in Bruna's villancico.
This image of the burnt offering is the primary metaphor in the \wtitle{Subida del monte Carmelo}. 
John writes that the soul in search of divine union, like Moses ascending Mount Sinai to build God an altar there (Ex 34:), must go through a process of self-emptying and thereby \quoted{ascend this mountain and make of herself an altar upon it, on which to offer to God a sacrifice of pure love, and pure praise and reverence}.%
	\autocite[191]{JuandelaCruz:Subida}

Though John does not use the metaphor of the phoenix, his theology of spiritual purgation and self-offering, read together with the other sources of early modern symbolism and metaphysics, provides a deeper theological foundation for understanding the symbolism of the phoenix and fire in Bruna's villancico.
Covarrubias and Ricciardo use the phoenix to represent the soul being transformed and brought to new life through a purgative death.
Covarrubias and Fray Luis show how this metaphor could work by explaining the physics of fire as it transforms matter and ascends to the heavens.
And St. John of the Cross uses fire to represent the Holy Spirit's transformation of the soul so that acts of love arise from it like flames from fire.

%********************
\subsubsection{The Voice as Flame}

The remaining element in the villancico to understand, then, is how the musical voice is connected to this theological symbolism of fire.
In early modern Spanish theology, the voice was linked to fire both analogically and actually.

As an analogy, as flames leap up from a fire, voices raised in worship arise from a soul full of love for God.
Both \wtitle{Suban las voces} and \wtitle{Llama de amor viva} use emotional interjections (\quoted{oh} for John, \quoted{ay} for Bruna) that go beyond linguistic communication into inarticulate expression.
In Bruna's setting, the refrain of \quoted{arde} is repeated so much as to function like an interjection as well.
John says that such words \quoted{signify affectionate praising, which, each time they are said, reveal more about the interior than what is said by the tongue}.%
	\autocite[790]{JuandelaCruz:Llama}
John calls his verses \foreign{canciones} (songs), and writes them in the form of \term{liras} (groups of three lines with seven, seven, and eleven syllables).
Even though as an ascetic reformer John did not endorse elaborate church music, these references to music, and his description of praise as going beyond what can be expressed in words, would still make his theology amenable to those outside his order who wished to incorporate music into their devotional practice.
In the terms of St. John of the Cross, vocal expression, both articulate and inarticulate, may be one of the \quoted{acts of love} that are the flames leaping up from the heart burning with the Holy Spirit.

Fray Luis's explanation of the physical world in terms of the four elements links the actual mechanism of vocal expression to the element of fire.
The body as microcosm is composed of the four elements, and Fray Luis explains that the voice is generated from the tension and exchange between them.
The heart is hot because it is fiery, and in order to cool off this fire and prevent harm to the body, God surrounded the heart with the lungs, which are full of cool air. 
The heat of the heart is cooled by the air of the lungs, and then comes forth through the throat.%
	%
	\autocite[435]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}
	%

In the throat, Fray Luis explains, the air meets with the voicebox, producing the voice.
Fray Luis praises the virtues of musical song produced by this voice, not yet articulated into words:
how different bodies produce different voices, as in the different parts of a chorus, and how their voices sounding together produce \quoted{tuneful music} (\foreign{música acordada}) for the service of the church.%	
	%
	\autocite[434]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}
	%
When the voice meets with the tongue, lips, and teeth, these organs 
	\quoted{articulate the voice, and thus various words are formed, with which the man as a political being explains and declares his thoughts and ideas with other men. \Dots{} 
	In this once again his providence shines forth, since the hot air that the heart gives forth, being dangerous to itself, serves [to produce] such a beneficial thing as the voice and speech of man}.%
	%
	\autocite[435]{LuisdeGranada:Simbolo}
	%

In Fray Luis's explanation, the voice literally arises through a kind of chemical process from the fire in the heart.
The useful fruit of the interplay of opposed elements (in this case, specifically opposed qualities of the elements---heat and cold) gives rise to the means through which a person may make tuneful music and express his inner thoughts to the external world.%

	\footnote{%
	Note the social aspect both of music and speech in Fray Luis's description.
	In his theology the voice is a means to create social relationships, including both ecclesial and political ones.

\subsection{%
Bruna's Musical Theology
}

The villancico set by Bruna depends on a web of theological and symbolic associations---between the phoenix, fire, the soul, and musical voices.
The soul not only burns, but becomes a burnt offering, in self-immolation like the phoenix.
In Bruna's villancico, this offering is explicitly tied to the sacrifice of the Eucharist (\poemlines{2--3}, \foreign{digan que en esta mesa/ fénix se abrasa un alma}), such that the soul's offering is united with Christ's.
This conceit fits well with the theology of divine union in St. John of the Cross, as expressed through the symbolism of fire.

In its function as devotional music, the villancico is able to embody these theological ideas in sounding reality.
Bruna's setting both represents these ideas like an auditory emblem and creates an affective world conducive to phoenix-like devotion.
The singers offer their voices to ascend to heaven like a burnt offering, and they invite the listeners to join them in this devotional \quoted{act of love}.

The emphasis in Bruna's villancico is less on contemplation (compared to Padilla or Cererols) and more on affect.
Though the piece today requires intellectual effort to understand---its theology of fire depends on a premodern cosmology and physics, and uses symbols whose meanings must be reconstructed---the function of the piece in its own time was likely not intellectual contemplation.
Instead, the piece would kindle the hearts of in performers and listeners to affective devotion.


The representation of music in this piece is, like Carrión's \wtitle{Qué destemplada armonía}, more centered on human music-making than on heavenly music, and it focuses on the ascent of earthly music to heaven rather than the reverse.
In Bruna's \wtitle{Suban las voces}, the performance embodies a theology of music as a form of self-offering for the musicians and for those listening sympathetically.
One influential patristic source for such a theology of worship is a passage from Augustine's \wtitle{City of God}, book 10.
Augustine condemns the Greco-Roman Neoplatonists because although they came close to Christian truth in their notion of the \quoted{one supreme good, the unchangeable God}, they still offered vain sacrifices to idols.
In contrast, Augustine teaches, the true sacrifice of a Christian is for the whole Christian community to offer itself as \quoted{a living sacrifice} (Rom 12:1) to God.
Only to the one true God, he preaches, \quoted{we owe the service which is
called in Greek \foreign{latreía}, \Dots{} for we are all His temple, each of us severally and all of us together \Dots}.%
	%
	\autocite[10:3, p.~306]{Augustine:CityofGod}
	%
Augustine's description of sacrifice resonates strongly with the theology of self-offering in Bruna's villancico and in the other theological sources examined thus far (as the emphasized phrases show):

%********************
\begin{quoting}
\emph{Our heart when it rises to Him is His altar}:
the priest who intercedes for us is His Only-begotten;
we sacrifice to Him bleeding victims when we contend for His truth even unto blood;
to Him we offer the sweetest incense when we come before Him burning with holy and pious love;
to Him we devote and surrender ourselves and His gifts in us;
to Him, by solemn feasts and on appointed days, we consecrate the memory of His benefits, lest through the lapse of time ungrateful oblivion should steal upon us;
\emph{to Him we offer on the altar of our heart the sacrifice of humility and praise, kindled by the fire of burning love.}%
	%
	\autocite[10:3, p.~306]{Augustine:CityofGod}
	%

This is the sacrifice of Christians: we being many, are one body in Christ.
And this also is the sacrifice which the Church continually celebrates in the sacrament of the altar, known to the faithful, in which she teaches that \emph{she herself is offered in the offering she makes to God}.%
	%
	\autocite[10:6, p.~310]{Augustine:CityofGod}
	%
\end{quoting}
%********************

While Augustine portrays the Eucharist as the summit of Christian sacrifice, his theology of sacrifice encompasses the whole church community, not only the bread and wine on the altar.
Under this theology of worship, music and liturgy would be included as part of the church's \quoted{sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving}, and Bruna's villancico both proclaims and performs this kind of communal offering to God.

The next section examines Miguel Ambiela's reworking of this piece, in which the devotional focus is shifted from the Eucharist to the Assumption of Mary.
But this Augustinian theology of worship as ecclesial self-offering continues to underly the use of music for sanctoral devotion, in which a villancico may serve as an intercessory offering to God by means of the broader communion of saints, chief among whom was the Blessed Virgin.

\section{Christ as a \term{Vihuela} in \wtitle{Qué música divina} by José de Cáseda}
\label{sec:Caseda}

In the final case study of \cref{part:unhearable-music}, José de Cáseda's \wtitle{Qué música divina}, one can hear echoes from this whole tradition.
And as we will see, this villancico demonstrates what happens when imitation---both the musical tradition of metamusical villancicos and the philosophical concept of music's power to represent theological truths---is stretched to its limit.

José de Cáseda's Eucharistic villancico \wtitle{Qué música divina} represents Christ as a \term{vihuela}, or a \term{vihuela} as Christ.
The piece evokes instrumental music vocally in order to use music to symbolize not heavenly perfection, but instead to evoke the human suffering of Christ on the cross as a result of humankind's sinful nature.
Cáseda forces his singers to make untuneful music that both highlights the imperfection of human music (as in previous metamusical examples) and also provides a vehicle for dramatic, affective human expression. 
Thus the piece forms a good endpoint to the trajectory we have traced from music functioning as a reflection of heaven to music expressing human affections.
Since this villancico survives in a manuscript from a convent in Puebla, it also demonstrates the global reach of this kind of music (yet another result of the interconnections among Hispanic musicians), and raises questions about the effect of performing venue and audience on the piece.

The musical oddities of Cáseda's villancico may reflect the strain of continuing the metamusical villancico tradition.
This piece thus represents the limits of imitation, in both the difficulty of outdoing previous compositions in the same musical tradition, and in the increasing struggle to accommodate musical aesthetics to the old cosmology even as belief in the old system was eroding.

The composer José de Cáseda (fl. 1691--1716) was raised and trained within a closely integrated network of composers, centered in the Zaragoza region of Aragon but with ties all across Spain and the New World.%
	%
	\footnote{
For what little is known of his biography, see \autocite[120--121]{Calahorra:Zaragoza2}; and \autocite{Stevenson:CasedaD}. 
	}
	%
José's father Diego has already appeared several times in these case studies; in Zaragoza he was chapelmaster first at the Basilica de El Pilar and then later at the Cathedral of La Seo.
José first served as chapelmaster of cathedrals in Calahorra and Pamplona. 
After Diego's death in 1695, José was appointed to succeed him as chapelmaster at La Seo in Zaragoza, where he remained until at least 1705.
Possibly through a connection with Miguel Mateo de Dallo y Lana (who emigrated from Seville to Puebla), music by both Cásedas made it across the Atlantic to New Spain, where it became part of the repertoire at the Conceptionist Convento de la Santísima Trinidad in Puebla.
Today that convent's collection survives as the Colección Jesús Sánchez Garza at the Mexican national music research center (CENIDIM) in Mexico City.
The collection includes eight villancicos attributed to a Cáseda, with three clearly credited to José (MEX-Mcen: CSG.151, 154, 155).%
	%
	\footnote{
	The numbers are from the still-unpublished catalog edited by Aurelio Tello.
	}
	%

The cheap paper and unprofessional handwriting of the manuscript (CSG.154) suggest that \wtitle{Qué música divina}, like most of the other villancicos in the collection, was copied by the sisters of La Santísima Trinidad for their own use in the convent.
Indeed, their names are written into the parts---the same names that may be seen in many other Sánchez Garza manuscripts from the same period.
The Tiple I part belonged to \quoted{Tomasita}, the Tiple II to \quoted{María de Jesús}, the Alto part to \quoted{Me. [Maestra?] Besona}, and the Tenor part to \quoted{Rosa María de Jesús}.
The instrumental bass part is not attributed.
The paper's watermarks and the handwriting are consistent with a copying date around 1700.
The handwriting may not be of professional quality, but it is no worse than the Barcelona manuscript of Bruna's \wtitle{Suban las voces} or the Canet manuscript of Cererols's \wtitle{Suspended, cielos}. 
The sisters of La Santísima Trinidad must have had quite a high level of musical ability, as this is a difficult piece, both in its performance demands and its aesthetic character. 

The musical style and poetic themes suggest a function for Eucharistic devotional services, like Bruna's \wtitle{Suban las voces}.
The condition of the partbooks suggests that Cáseda's piece was performed frequently in the Puebla convent.
In fact, a sewn-in line of music in the Tenor part, which may have served as a way to abridge the coplas or adapt the villancico for solo performance, shows that later convent sisters valued this work highly enough to adapt it for new performative or liturgical demands.

%****************************************
\subsection{Metamusical Tropes in the Poetry: Experiencing a Higher Music}

The poetry of the estribillo reads like a catalog of the metamusical tropes we have been tracing in these case studies of \quoted{singing about singing} (\cref{poem:Que_musica_divina-estribillo}).
The terms used in Cáseda's villancico to describe music are all familiar by now from the vocabulary of this tradition: \quoted{acorde}, \quoted{soberana}, \quoted{tiernas}, \quoted{armoniosas}. 
The key terms \quoted{consonancia}, \quoted{quiebros}, and \quoted{accentos}, are common to all the pieces studied previously.
The term \quoted{cláusulas} specifically recalls \wtitle{Suspended, cielos}, as set by Cererols. 
Like Irízar's \wtitle{Qué música celestial} and the variant settings of \wtitle{Suban las voces al cielo} by Pablo Bruna and Miguel Ambiela, the poem also connects music with the element of air through reference to the winds.

% 	\input{poems/Que_musica_divina-Caseda-coplas}
% \end{expoem}
% %*******************

Cáseda's poem begins with a rhetorical exclamation of wonder about a mysterious higher form of music, as did Irízar's \wtitle{¿Qué música celestial es la que hoy el aire altera?} and Jerónimo de Carrión's \wtitle{Qué destemplada armonía de confusas voces varias}.
Irízar's opening uses the same term (\quoted{el oído eleva}), which like Carrión, rhetorically presents dismay at the power of a strange, unexpected kind of music.
This emphasis on the human sensory and affective response to music fits with the general trend we have seen (in Irízar and Carrión) away from music as a reflection of heaven, such as the music of the spheres, and toward the evocation and incitement of human affects.

The final lines of Cáseda's estribillo describe the \quoted{divine music} as elevating the senses and dismaying the body's powers: here the poet distinguishes between two technical terms for human faculties, the \quoted{sentidos} and \quoted{potencias}.
As explained in chapter~\ref{ch:theology}, early modern physiology distinguished between the exterior senses, which Fray Luis calls \foreign{sentidoes exteriores}, and the interior senses (the imaginative, cogitative, and other faculties), which Fray Luis describes as \foreign{potencias}.
In Cáseda's villancico, the \quoted{divine music} \quoted{elevates the senses} but \quoted{confounds the powers}.
Cáseda's \quoted{sentidos} would most likely refer to the exterior senses---hearing in particular---and \quoted{potencias}, to these mental faculties, what might be called \quoted{powers of reason}.
Coplas 5 and 6 (\cref{poem:Que_musica_divina-coplas}) expand on this idea: the divine music \quoted{is not to the senses} (\poemlines{28}), but its \quoted{excellence} or virtuosity (\quoted{primor}) \quoted{elevates to the heavens the one who reaches it} (\poemlines{32}).
Here copla 6 connects the divine music to the Eucharist: the mystery of either is more than the exterior senses perceive it to be, and therefore \quoted{sensation does not eat it, for your music is fodder for the soul} (\poemlines{31--34}).

The basic concept of \quoted{sentidos} and \quoted{potencias} in this villancico, then, seems to be that the divine music defies the external senses but elevates the internal powers of the mind/soul.
This idea seems to fuse the Neoplatonic contemplative function of music with affective experience: perhaps rational/spiritual reflection on the divine mysteries is achieved not through ignoring the senses, but through an experience of the senses being confounded.
Such a theology of sensory experience would align closely with that of St. John of the Cross, in which affective experience functions like \quoted{mother's milk}, leading the contemplative toward a higher plane of spirituality in which that sensory experience is no longer necessary.

To describe this dismaying higher form of music, the coplas of Cáseda's villancico, contrasting with all the generic tropes in the estribillo, center on the theological-musical conceit of Christ as a \quoted{divine and human \term{cítara}}.
The villancico uses this musical instrument---whose ambiguous definition led to a rich range of symbolic meanings---as a metaphor for the highest form of Music.

In this poem, Christ unites the high and low like two strings of the \term{cítara} tuned to each other at the octave (copla 1). 
Christ unites these extremes as the strings are stretched between the two ends of a \term{cítara} (\quoted{lazo} also calls to mind the lash used on Christ in his crucifixion).
This is fitting, since Christ was stretched out on the cross just as the strings are stretched over the bridge, and the three nails put in his hands (\quoted{clavos}) are the pegs (\quoted{clavijas}) that hold the strings in place (copla 3).
The lance pierced his innards as a plectrum plucks strings (\quoted{herir} being the same word for both \quoted{pluck} and \quoted{wound}).
And as, according to John's Gospel (19:34) blood and water flowed from Christ's wound, which in Tridentine theology were understood as the fountainhead of the seven sacraments, these are compared to the \quoted{seven orders} or strings of a \term{vihuela}.

%********************
\subsection{Theological Tropes of the Cithara and Vihuela}

But if Christ is a musical instrument, is he a \term{cítara} or a \term{vihuela}?
The specific reference in copla 4 and other details make clear that the metaphor in this villancico is specific to the Spanish \quoted{seven-order} vihuela.
But the symbolic use of the vihuela is piggybacking on a millenium of allegorical treatments of the other instrument.
The meanings of the \term{cithara} in early modern Latin and its Spanish cognate \term{cítara} developed from a long practice of interpreting an ancient musical term of unclear meaning through the lens of familiar contemporary practice.

The Jewish translators of the Septuagint a century before Christ used
\term{kithara}, the term for some kind of lyre or harp used in ancient Greek writings, to translate several ancient Hebrew terms whose precise meanings in some cases remain unclear today.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	For a full discussion of the different terms in ancient Near Eastern languages and the archeological and iconographic evidence for their meaning, see \autocite{Lawergren:Lyres}.
	}
	%
Tracing the use of \term{cithara} in the Vulgate back through the corresponding passages in the Greek (the original text of the New Testament and the Septuagint translation of Old), through the Hebrew Scriptures, the most common Hebrew word standing in the same place as the Vulgate \term{cithara} is \term{kinnôr}.
The \term{kinnôr} was some kind of lyre with plucked or strummed strings; Josephus said it had ten strings.%
	%
	\autocites[\sv{Music: Strings}]{Bromily:BibleEncyclopedia}
	%
In Gen 4:21 this is one of the first instruments ever invented by \quoted{Jubal, the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe} (NRSV).

In the Septuagint, the names of these two instruments are translated as the
\foreign{psaltērion} and \foreign{kithara}.
St. Jerome rendered this passage in the Latin Vulgate with the words
\foreign{cithara et organo}, transliterating the Greek \foreign{kithara} and perhaps trying to recuperate the sense of a wind instrument in the other Hebrew word, which the Septuagint translators had turned into a stringed instrument, the \term{psalterion}.

This example is one of several that demonstrate how the precise meaning of a musical term could be lost in the transfer between Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
In the Vulgate, the instrument David plays for Saul in ISam 16:16 is a \term{cithara}.
In Hebrew this was again \term{kinnôr}, rendered in the Septuagint with another
frequently used translation, \foreign{kinura}.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	This Greek word may be a loanword from the Hebrew: \autocite{Brown:HebrewOTLexicon}{}.
	}
	%
The same transfer of terms happens in the descriptions of worship in the Davidic
tabernacle (1 Chron. 15:28, 16:4--6): in Hebrew David's temple musicians play
the \foreign{kinnôr}; in Greek, the \foreign{kinura}, and in the Vulgate they
play \foreign{citharae}.%

For Christian theology, the most prominent Biblical locus for the Greek
\foreign{kinura} and Latin Vulgate \term{cithara} is in the New Testament Revelation to John.
In Rev 14:2-4, John hears a chorus of 144,000 virgins singing \quoted{a new song
before the throne}, and both the Greek and the Latin onomatopoetically echo
their sound, \foreign{sicut citharoedorum citharizantium in citharis suis} (\quoted{harpers harping on their harps} in the King James), a passage whose meaning Craig Monson has already elucidated.%
	%
	\autocite[88--95]{Monson:DivasConvent}
	%

Many medieval exegetes commenting on the Latin Vulgate likely had no idea (or desire to know) what actual instrument the term \term{cithara} referred to, and concerned themselves instead with analogical interpretations.
By the seventeenth century, the term had become a rich node of allegorical connections.
In a 1603 commentary on the Apocalypse, the Jesuit Francisco Ribera draws on the venerable Bede to interpret the cithara played by the saints in Rev 14: as symbolic of the saints' bodily mortification: 
\quoted{Counted among the cithara-players of God are all the saints, who, having crucified their flesh with its vices and sinful desires praise God with the psalter and cithara}.%
	%
	\footnote{
	\autocite[429]{Ribera:Apocalypse}.
This is probably the symbolism behind the use of this reading for the Mass of the Feast of Holy Innocents (Jan. 28).
	} 
	%

Cornelius a Lapide takes the connection between cithara and crucifixion farther.
In his commentary on ISam 16:, when David (in the Latin version) plays the cithara to drive the demons away from King Saul, Lapide gives an epitome of the whole patristic and medieval tradition regarding the power of music over the affects.
Surveying the exegetical tradition to its earliest and most obscure sources---Lapide cites Angelomus of Luxeuil, Prosper of Aquitaine, Eucherius of Lyon, and Ambrosius Ansbertus---Lapide summarizes a traditional interpretation of the cithara:
\quoted{Allegorically, the cithara represents the cross of Christ; for just as the strings of a cithara are stretched out, thus Christ was stretched out on the cross}.%
	\Autocite[370]{Lapide:1Samuel}
Lapide cites Augustine (\wtitle{Sermo 3 de tempore}) to say that \quoted{the cithara represents the flesh of Christ}: speaking apparently of the Greek three-stringed lyre, Augustine makes this a metaphor for the unity of the three Persons of the Holy Trinity, incarnate in the body of Christ.%
	%
	\Autocite[370]{Lapide:1Samuel}
	%
Once again it is apparent how the ambiguous meaning of the instrument name gave theologians great flexibility in interpreting the instrument symbolically.

Lapide joins Ribera in citing the Venerable Bede for the allegorical reading of the cithara.%
	%
	\footnote{%
Bede's complete works had been published in Basel in 1563 (preserved in Madrid, E-Mn:~M/1069); they were newly published in Cologne in 1688 (preverved in Puebla's Biblioteca Palafoxiana,~MEX-Ppx: BS535-B4).
	}
	%
Indeed, in a commentary on ISam 19:10 (in which Saul attacks David with a lance while David is playing music), Bede uses language strikingly similar to that of Cáseda's villancico, as shown in the added emphases:

\begin{quoting}
The cithara [citara] of David especially may figuratively demonstrate the cross of the Lord, the lance [lancea] of Saul may be compared to the nails [clavos] of the cross, as well as the soldier's lance, by which the Lord's side was opened.%
	\autocite[123]{Bede:Commentaries2}
\end{quoting}
%
Note Bede's use of the terms \quoted{clavos} (the exact cognate is used in the Spanish villancico) and \quoted{lancea} (\quoted{lanza} in the Spanish).

All of these sources manifest a strong theological tradition behind the use of the cithara in Cáseda's villancico as an allegory for Christ's incarnate body and his crucifixion.
Moreover, Craig Monson has traced how this symbolic tradition was applied specifically to female monastics, citing St. Bonaventure for \quoted{this relationship between Christ's suffering body, the kithara, and the female monastic}---which would give the piece a special resonance in the context of the Puebla convent community.%
	%
	\autocite[93--94]{Monson:DivasConvent}
	%

By the time Lapide's allegorical reading of the cithara was published, humanist research was already beginning to uncover the original meanings of the cithara and the Hebrew instruments given that Latin name.
Athanasius Kircher, dedicated separate chapters of the \wtitle{Musurgia} to the musical instruments of the ancient Hebrews and Greeks, and attempted to clarify the differences between the various Hebrew and Greek terms used for stringed instruments.
Kircher cites the same passage from Gen 4:21 discussed above, printing both the Hebrew and Greek versions, and noting the variance in translation of the instrument names.
Kircher says that \foreign{cythara} is the translation for the Hebrew words (in his transliteration) \quoted{Assur, Neuel, Kinnor, Maghul, Minnim}.
The \quoted{Kinnor}, Kircher says, \quoted{is in fact of a similar character to the \emph{Cytharæ} of today}, and provides an illustration of what he thinks the Hebrew instrument looked like (\cref{fig:Kircher-kinnor}).%
	\autocite[I:~44--49]{Kircher:Musurgia}
Note how the Latin term constrains Kircher: though he is attempting to compare the Hebrew instrument to a modern one, his use of the ambiguous Latin \foreign{cythara} works against him---what was \quoted{the cithara of today}{}?
In his discussion of Greek music, Kircher speaks of \quoted{cytharæ} without giving a clear definition.
Comparing of ancient and modern music, Kircher boasts that the \quoted{cytharœdi} of today (cithara players, using the same term from Rev 14:2) are as superior to their ancient Greek counterparts as their modern instruments are superior to the ancient ones.
	%
	\autocite[I:~548]{Kircher:Musurgia}
	%

Kircher does attempt to define the \quoted{cythara} as a term for modern plucked string instruments, though again the Latin word leaves his definitions ambiguous.
In his illustrations of modern \quoted{cytharæ} (\cref{fig:Kircher-citharae}), the \quoted{common Cythara} has a round body and seventeen strings; the \quoted{German and Italian Cythara} has a pear-shaped body and four double courses (possibly a mandolin).
Most significantly, Kircher's \quoted{Spanish Cythara} appears to be a vihuela with five double courses.

In describing modern instruments, using vernacular names would have increased the accuracy of his descriptions but diminished its universality, and all the rich associations of the cithara would have been lost.
There is a pronounced tension throughout the \wtitle{Musurgia}---and throughout early modern Catholic culture---between the desire to preserve the Latin Catholic traditions, with their analogical ways of thinking, and the desire to investigate the modern world scientifically and empirically.
Kircher presents \quoted{scientific} knowledge about the ancient world and encyclopedic descriptions of modern practice, but he also wants to preserve the allegorical traditions of Catholic theology and speculative music theory.
For example, the entire second book of the \wtitle{Musurgia} is based on a sustained metaphor comparing all of creation to a Greek four-stringed lyre, another instrument often grouped with the cithara as a source for allegory.

John Hollander appraises the early modern situation similarly, seeing the substitution of modern instruments for the cithara in the early modern period (\quoted{apparently based on the notion that any obsolete instrument is the equivalent of any other}) as emblematic of how poets struggled to accommodate musical concepts from the ancient world to modern reality.
Hollander describes a symbolic \quoted{{`lute-harp-lyre'} constellation, uniting the contemporary instrument with those of David and Orpheus}.%
	%
	\autocite[44--51]{Hollander:Untuning}
	%
Hollander argues that by this point in the seventeenth century, the interest of poets and musicians writing on musical subjects turned away from musical philosophy (music of the spheres and so on) and toward actual musical practice. 
In a similar way, the poet of Cáseda's villancico takes the cithara, with all the analogical possibilities connected to it, and maps it onto a specific modern instrument---the distinctly Spanish seven-course vihuela.

Spanish church music was distinctive among European traditions in its widespread inclusion of several plucked stringed instruments not used elsewhere, primarily, the harp, guitar, and vihuela. 
The terminological and symbolic ambiguity of the cithara allowed Spanish artists considerable license in connecting their contemporary musical practice to the ancient sources.
Many Spanish cathedral Choirs include depictions of King David with his cithara (or harp, or lyre) as a way of demonstrating continuity with the music of the ancient Hebrew Temple (a concept also expressed through the \quoted{Solomonic columns} built into the high altar of Puebla Cathedral in 1649, and thereafter widely imitated). 

On the walls and ceilings of the cathedrals of Puebla and Mexico City, these instruments may be seen in the hands of angelic musicians.
The Chapel of the Rosary (Capilla del Rosario), built in Puebla around 1680, also includes a \wtitle{Glorification of the Virgin} amid an angelic ensemble that includes either a vihuela or a guitar.
Juan Correa's painting of the same subject in the sacristy of Mexico City Cathedral (\circa1685) specifically includes a vihuela in a heavenly consort of harp, lyre, lute, and viols (to mention only the stringed instruments).
In this painting (\cref{fig:Correa-Sacristy}), it is as though Correa takes the Biblical passage about \quoted{citharoedorum citharizantium in citharis suis} (Rev 14:2) and, drawing on the diverse interpretations of the cithara, includes in the heavenly ensemble every instrument used in contemporary cathedral practice that could possibly be considered a cithara.

Though the more common type of vihuela had six orders (that is, six pairs of strings), Bermudo also desribes a \quoted{vihuela de siete órdenes}, as mentioned in Cáseda's villancico.%

This instrument (\cref{fig:Bermudo-vihuela7}), Bermudo says, was particularly suited to playing polyphony, such as five-voice works by Gombert (this is notable because the Cáseda villancico is scored for five voices).

demonstrating the use of vihuelas in the cathedral and suggesting their use as well in the closely related musical ensemble of the Convento de la Santísima Trinidad.

We know that women religious played the vihuela because one of the two surviving vihuelas from this period, in the church of La Compañia de Jesús in Quito, Ecuador, is believed to have been the possession of the nun Santa Mariana de Jesús (1618--1645).
According to contemporary accounts, Mariana was especially skilled on the instrument. 
The theological worth then attributed to the vihuela is shown in an account of one Christmas night (probably during the Matins service, when villancicos were performed), when Mariana \quoted{sat down to make music playing a vihuela, and she said that she wanted to offer this music among the angels who were attending there}.

It is quite likely that the nuns of La Santísima Trinidad in Puebla also included at least one vihuela in their musical ensemble---and it would certainly seem strange for them not to use that instrument in performing a villancico that used it as a metaphor for Christ.

In the case of Cáseda's villancico, the specific details of the vihuela---its construction, tuning, playing technique, and typical stylistic idioms---provide new analogical possibilities for the poet to extend the cithara tradition.
More importantly, this poetic conceit of Christ as vihuela also provides Cáseda as a composer with possibilites for actually representing the cithara symbol through sound.

%********************

\subsection{Representing the Vihuela, Representing Christ}

In the poetry of Cáseda's villancico, the specifications of the vihuela become symbols for Christ, particularly for his body, which suffered on the cross, was raised and made present to believers through the Eucharist.
The vihuela's seven strings here symbolize the seven sacraments.
According to Bermudo, the most common tuning for the seven strings was in intervals of alternating fifths and fourths starting from a lowest string on G (\term{gamma, ut}) (that is, G\textsubscript{2}).%
	%
	\autocite[109r--109v]{Bermudo:Declaracion}
	%
That would make the strings G\octave{2}--D\octave{3}--G\octave{3}--D\octave{4}--G\octave{4}--D\octave{5}--G\octave{5}.
Thus the highest and lowest strings are tuned in octaves, as copla 1 says: \quoted{forma unida la alta con la baja}.
If this phrase referred to \quoted{that which is high} or low in general, it would have been gendered masculine, \quoted{lo alto con lo bajo}; but since it is feminine, it makes more sense as modifying \quoted{cuerdas} from the first line---the high string with the low string.
Moreover, all the strings are tuned in perfect intervals, as copla 2 says: \quoted{en cada punto entera consonancia} (in each point or note a whole consonance).
The \quoted{lazo} could refer either to the bow of a \term{vihuela de arco}, or to a plectrum that was sometimes used in place of the fingertips.

The poet has even incorporated the instrumental symbolism into the structure of the verse (here playing on the common conflation of cithara, lyre, and Greek \term{lira}).
The poem itself is composed primarily in lines of 7 and 11 syllables, beginning with the pattern 7--7--7--11--11; this would seem to be a type of \term{lira} meter, like the one used in the \wtitle{Llama de amor viva} of St. John of the Cross.
Seven is also the number of courses on the vihuela described in the poem (\poemlines{26}).
So the poem itself is a \term{lira}, even as it describes a cithara/lira/vihuela as symbolic of Christ.

Whether or not an actual vihuela was used for this villancico, Cáseda represents the vihuela musically through the compositional structure.
First, he features the continuo section prominently, spotlighting all the cithara-like instruments that might have been played.
The piece begins with the Tiple I (sister Tomasita in Puebla) singing a solo against the continuo with widely-spaced open fifths and octaves between them: the vihuela or other continuo instruments filling in the intervening space would have stood out clearly.
Again in \measures{2}, when the Tiple I makes the striking leap up to the B\fl{}, she is joined only by the continuo.
In \measures{13}, there is an abrupt harmonic shift initiated by the continuo alone, which here leads the singers rather than just accompanying them.

Cáseda also gives the continuo several solos throughout the piece.
The first solo comes at the conclusion of the first three lines of poetry (\measures{9}).
Surely the composer intended for more music to sound here than simply the falling fifth of the melodic bass line.
Indeed, with the vocalists having just sung that the \quoted{divine music \Dots\ rivals that of the birds}, it would seem natural for an instrumentalist to fill in a little trilling bird music here.
Cáseda allows more such possibilities in the coplas (\measures{52, 54, 57, 72, 76--77, 80}): in the first example, the ensemble sings \quoted{let the divine strings resound}, and then there are two semiminims of vocal rest while, we may assume, the continuo ensemble does just that.

Cáseda also has the singers themselves imitate the vihuela.
In the opening gesture, the Tiple I sings her solo with continuo accompaniment, followed by the rest of the vocal ensemble in a homorhythmic echo (\cref{ex:CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-opening}).
The \quoted{voicing} here (as in chord voicing) resembles the tuning of a vihuela, with the open fifths and fourths in the three lower vocal parts of \measures{1--2}.
The dotted rhythm, sung all together, and the contrary motion between voices, mimic the effect of strummed open strings on a vihuela.
The general texture of soloist against a regular rhythmic, chordal accompaniment also evokes someone singing while playing (like Santa Mariana de Jesús of Quito, and the \quoted{citharoedi} of Rev. 14).
This image would be even clearer in the coplas sung by soloists with only continuo accompaniment.

% %*******************
% \begin{example}
% 	\includeWideFigure{scores-examples/CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-opening}
% 	\caption{Cáseda, \wtitle{Qúe música divina}, \measures{1--6}}
% 	\label{ex:CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-opening}
% \end{example}
% %*******************

The vocal textures from \measures{6} on are more typical of vocal music, particularly in the paired, ornament-like figures in the sections from \measures{11--15, 19--29}.
After \measures{18}, Cáseda realizes the common villancico poetic trope of birdsong by giving the singers birdlike trill patterns. 
At the end of the estribillo, Cáseda returns to musically representing the vihuela/cithara trope.
In the last eight compases (\measures{47--50}), the rhythmic pattern in the voices---a minim rest and two minims---again suggests strumming (see \cref{ex:CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-clausulas} below).
If this passage were played by a vihuelist in an intabulation, the player would likely use a down-up-up strumming pattern, similar to the patterns recommended for guitarists and harpists in Lucas Ruíz de Ribayaz's manual \wtitle{Luz y norte musical} of 1677 (\cref{fig:Ruiz-9-strumming}).%
	%
	\autocite[9]{Ruiz:Luz}
	%
In this rhythmic pattern, Cáseda inserts rests between syllables of the words in this passage; this rhetorical technique of \wtitle{tmesis} creates the gasping effect of \quoted{dismayed}, arrested senses.

% %********************
% \begin{figure}
% 	\includeNarrowFigure{figures/Ruiz-9-strumming}
% 	\caption{Strumming patterns in Ruíz de Ribayaz, \wtitle{Luz y norte musical}}
% 	\label{fig:Ruiz-9-strumming}
% \end{figure}
% %********************


In the coplas, the homorhythmic, dotted opening phrase again seems to mimic strumming.
For the phrase \quoted{forma unida la alta con la baja} (\measures{62--66}), Cáseda sets the text on multiple levels at once.
In \measures{62--63}, the Tenor sings a pedal D\textsubscript{4}, like a droning open string, against the Alto's moving line.
Thus the \quoted{alta} Alto (with a woman singer the feminine adjective takes on an additional layer of meaning) is paired with the lowest voice.
The Tenor, meanwhile, forms perfect consonances (octave and fifth) with the Bass, which (if a vihuela) would likely be playing open D and G strings here. 
The Tenor is thus acting like one of the strings on the vihuela.
Finally, the Tenor line concludes with a minor-sixth leap down to F\sh{} on the word \quoted{baja}, painting the text with a traditional madrigalism.
All of these ideas are then repeated in the next phrase, \measures{64--66}, now with G pedals matching the highest string on the standard vihuela (G\textsubscript{5}).

These evocations of the vihuela would seem to fit with Hollander's thesis that early modern poets shifted their interest from speculative views of music based on ancient sources toward the details of practical contemporary music.
But Cáseda's villancico does not abandon traditional analogical thinking; if anything it makes the metaphor more specific (and therefore more powerful) by using not just the abstract term \term{cithara}, but a particular type of vihuela. 
In classic Neoplatonic fashion, the piece shows listeners how to hear \wtitle{musica instrumentalis} while listening for the higher Music of Christ. 
The real, sounding vihuela (if indeed there was one) is only a symbol of Christ.
It is Christ's musical \quoted{excellence} that is praised, not that of any human virtuosi.

%********************
\subsection{The Problem of Hearing and Faith}

Eucharistic villancicos like this one tended to emphasize the mysterious, sense-defying nature of the holy sacrament. 
In the words of St. Thomas Aquinas, the fundamental doctrinal authority on sacramental theology for early modern Catholics, \quoted{That the true body of Christ and his blood are in this sacrament, cannot be grasped by sensation [neque sensu] nor by intellect, but by faith alone, which rests on divine authority}.%
	\footnote{\wtitle{Summa theologica} III, question 75, article 1; 1859 ed. p. 274}
Cáseda's copla 5, \quoted{No son a los sentidos} (\poemlines{27}) seems to echo Aquinas's phrase \quoted{neque sensu}, and certainly reflects the same Eucharistic theology.
In Cáseda's poem (\poemlines{33}), \quoted{sensation does not eat it}; for as Aquinas explains in the same article, Christ's body is eaten in a sacramental, not literally physical way.

From the theology of transubstantiation it would follow that music should be especially apt for the Eucharist (both as metaphor and liturgical practice) because of the analogy between the mysterious way both appealed to the senses.
Like Christ's presence in the Eucharist, a musical voice was a kind of presence that was in the world but in a way not of it. 
This presence was independent of the singer's or player's body: it transmitted something of their essence without any physical contact.
Further, the ear could be deceived by echoes, feigned voices, or false speech, as the character Hearing says of himself in Calderón \wtitle{El nuevo palacio del Retiro} (discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:theology}).
One could even hear something said or sung with perfect clarity, but not understand it for lack of the proper disposition or intellectual preparation.

This problematic theology of faith and hearing is presented in Cáseda's villancico through the specific metaphor of Christ as a stringed instrument.
\quoted{Of faith he is the intrument}, the poem says, \quoted{and his music regales the ear [or, hearing]} (copla 2).
Coplas 3 and 4, as we have seen, describe the \quoted{music} played upon that instrument: namely, Christ's sacrificial death on the cross.
But, as copla 5 says, \quoted{those things that his sovereign voices [or words] sound are not for the senses}---literally, they do not sound to the senses. 
In other words, this music is not something that can be heard with the ears.
Indeed, the copla continues, \quoted{as many voices [or words] as the senses perceived from this instrument will be false} or out of tune.
So if the ears \emph{could} hear this music, they would perceive it as being out of tune, or it would sound otherwise false, untrue, strange. 
All this seems to be a way of saying---in line with Aquinas---that those who rely on their senses, understood through reason alone, to grasp the mystery of Christ in the Eucharist will fail.
Like Calderón's \quoted{Judaísmo}, they would be hearing Faith without faith.

Obviously the main reason for this is that (as Aquinas explains) the eyes see only bread, the hands feel only bread, where really in Catholic belief, after the consecration the substance of the bread is transformed into that of Christ.
Furthermore, in the seventeenth century, the words of consecration were either whispered by the priest or not spoken at all (as contemporary ritual books specify), and most participants in the liturgy received the bread only rarely and the cup never.
Thus the Eucharist for most Catholics was something literally beyond all sensation, an utter mystery kept out of reach and mostly out of sight.
But if participants in the liturgy did not have direct physical contact with Christ in the sacrament, they did have direct access---through their sense of hearing---to the liturgical music.
When this music was itself about communion with Christ, it was able to serve as a kind of \quoted{sacramental}, that is, something outside the seven official sacraments that nevertheless was a means of encountering God through the material world (such as holy oil or water outside the sacraments of Confirmation or Baptism).

As the Council of Trent and the Tridentine Catechism firmly emphasized, Christ's sacrifice on the cross was ritually enacted and made present again on the altar as an propitiatory offering to God and a means of communion for humanity. 
This connection between Christ's crucifixion and the Eucharist explains the emphasis on both in Cáseda's villancico, and it adds another dimension to the musical metaphor.
According to Cáseda's coplas 3 and 4, if Christ is a vihuela, the music played on the instrument of his body is his crucifixion.
On the cross, the sinless Christ exchanged places with sinful humanity.
As St. Paul puts it, \quoted{For our sake he [God] made him [Christ] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God} (IICor 5:21, NRSV).

We have previously seen that metamusical villancicos frequently use dissonance or being out of tune as a symbol for sin. 
In Jerónimo de Carrión's \wtitle{Qué destemplada armonía} (chapter~\ref{ch:Segovia}), the fallen nature of humanity (that is, the \term{musica humana}) is presented as an out-of-tune or \quoted{untempered harmony}. 
To read Cáseda's villancico together with Carrión's, then, the reason why the music played on Christ the vihuela sounds \quoted{false} is that in his crucifixion Christ is taking on humanity's sinful nature.
This villancico represents Christ taking upon himself that out-of-tune music in order to create harmony between humanity and God.
Cáseda's villancico allows listeners to contemplate that Music, the \quoted{mysterious excellence} or \quoted{virtuosity} of Christ the divine musician, that \quoted{elevates to the heavens the one who reaches it} in mystical union with Christ.%
	%
	\footnote{%
	The term \quoted{primor} is also used in musical treatises such as that of Bermudo, as in the \quoted{primores} or basic principles (or perhaps fundamental skills) of counterpoint.
	}
	%
In musical terms, then, the believer must tune himself to Christ, since Christ already harmonized himself with humanity.

%********************
\subsection{False Music}

This theology of music provides Cáseda with a license to represent musical \quoted{falsehood} to the extreme.
Cáseda's exercises in depicting discord go beyond the mild dissonance used by Cererols.
In his opening (\cref{ex:CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-opening}), Cáseda writes direct octaves between the voice and accompaniment (in the leap up to B\fl, \measures{2}), and emphasizes them by cutting out all the other voices.
In the next two compases, Cáseda sets the word \foreign{acorde} (tuneful) to bald parallel fifths between outer voices.
Cáseda suspends the Alto's B\fl, so that these fifths move into a dissonant seventh sonority.

These contrapuntal solecisms are what Bermudo, in his treatise on instruments cited earlier about the vihuela, called musical \quoted{falsehood}.
He gives specific examples of parallel fifths and octaves, comparing them to \quoted{barbarism in grammar}.
In condemning this error, which he says is common for beginners and instrumentalists, Bermudo uses some of the same key terms as Cáseda's villancico:

\begin{quoting}
I want to say that there are those taken for musicians who have learned without a teacher and with much labor, and they are faults, and they know few principles [primores]. 
This pestilence is especially great for keyboard players. 
This is what that outstanding musician of blessed memory, Cristóbal de Morales, told me once, that if what many organists played would be written out we would find great faults. 
And he had good reason to say it: because they can play two octaves and two fifths and not perceive it [because of the organ's timbre]: while singing it they would recognize the falsehood [falsedad].%
        \autocite[f.~128v]{Bermudo:Declaracion}
\end{quoting}

Thus the kind of counterpoint Cáseda has written in his opening passage is musical \quoted{falsedad}, the same term used in Cáseda's copla 5 to describe the Music of Christ's Passion.
To depict this idea, Cáseda has his musicians create \quoted{false} music through \quoted{dangerous} and even blatantly erroneous counterpoint.
Cáseda uses rhythmic \quoted{falsehood} as well: in \measures{18} Cáseda switches from C meter to CZ, but never gives the listeners a chance to hear a \quoted{normal} CZ  rhythmic pattern (such as the flowing three-minim groups after \measures{30}). 
Instead he uses sesquialtera to alter the rhythm, and since no normal CZ  pattern has been established, the effect is not of hemiola but simply of a slow triple meter.

But it is in Cáseda's counterpoint that the idea of \quoted{falsehood} is performed most strikingly. 
In the section beginning in \measures{30}, Cáseda tries out \foreign{cláusula varias} (various cadences), creating an effect as though all the voices were continually trying to cadence (\cref{ex:CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-clausulas}).
Each of the voices sings a typical cadential pattern, but at different times and not quite aligning relative to the others.
The chromaticism becomes more acute as the passage continues, culminating in a bizarre collision in \measures{36--37}.
The bottom four voices here on their own in \measures{36} would appear to be cadencing on F, with the C in the bass to move up by fourth and the cadential E in the Tiple II to resolve up to F.
But the top voice seems determined to cadence on G, so that in the fifth minim of \measures{36} the top voice is an augmented fourth above the bass (F\sh{} against C), while the Alto's E is made to seem dissonant even when by rights it should not be.
In \measures{37} the voices manages to cadence on D, with the top voice settling back down to F\sh, though the Tenor has re-entered just at this point to sing an unprepared dissonant B\fl{} over the bass (making an augmented fifth against the Tiple I's F\sh).

% \end{example}
% %*******************

The final section of the estribillo (\cref{ex:CasedaJ-Que_musica_divina-clausulas}) continues in this direction, as Cáseda's music evokes the poetic idea of \quoted{elevating the senses} and \quoted{dismaying the [bodily] powers}.
He begins with a wedge pattern between the Tenor and the accompaniment (vihuela?), again juxtaposing B\fl{} (in the bass) with F\sh{} (in the tenor).
Cáseda brings in the next two voices, each one singing one of the two patterns already introduced: the Alto has the ascending line, and the Tiple 2 has the descending one.
But their entrances are reversed from that of the bass and Tenor, so a reverse wedge is created.
As this is happening, in \measures{41}, the Tiple I enters from out of nowhere with a high A, skipping down to what is apparently an F\na{} (based on the F\sh{} specified at the beginning of the next compás).
The A creates a \musfig{\na6}{\fl3} sonority: on its own it is an imperfect consonance with the bass, but against the E\fl{} in the Tiple II it certainly has the effect of elevating and dismaying, amplified by the direct fifths it then forms (again) with the bass as it skips down to F.
As though to ensure that listeners did not think this a mistake, Cáseda repeats the whole passage again in \measures{46} (though with the voices rearranged).
The estribillo ends with an alternating pattern of seventh chords over D (dominant sevenths) and minor triads on G, like the strumming of the two most common chords on a vihuela or guitar, known to us as I and V\textsuperscript{7}.

These readings of the counterpoint have been dependent on guesses about how the singers would have inflected the written pitches using \term{musica ficta}.
The practice of improvised accidentals appears to have remained alive in the Spanish realms longer than in other lands, and in New Spain in particular. 
This manuscript of Cáseda's manuscript requires many added accidentals, as those in small print above the music in the transcription demonstrate.
But in a passage like the strange collision of cadences in \measures{36--37}, the rules become confusing.
The Tiple II might begin the last phrase (starting in \measures{34} on F), singing the E as part of a cadential formula on F and therefore natural; but when the cadence comes on D, an E\fl{} might be preferable. 
Either option clashes with the notated F\sh{} in the Tiple I.

In \measures{45}, on \quoted{potencias desmaya}, the ficta situation becomes actually impossible.
To maintain the fugal motive, the Tiple II would have to sing three minim B flats and then a semibreve B\na, leading up to C.
But in the same place as the Tiple II B flats, the Tenor has a notated sharp sign on the B (the only way of indicating B\na).
The accidental in the Tenor part is clearly a sharp, written in the same hand  and with the same ink as the rest of the music.
This creates a cross relation---in Spansih, a \quoted{falsa relación}---between the B flat and B natural.

Any educated musicians confronted with this score would attempt to \quoted{fix} these problems (probably by singing all B naturals in the Tiple II).
But the passage is impossible to fix.
One feels that any solution chosen is the wrong one.
And there is now the added difficulty for the musicians of how to perform music that is supposed to sound out of tune.
How to apply ficta, how to tune intervals, when the composer is forcing the musicians to break the traditional rules?

The music is false: it cannot be emended with the further falsehood of musica ficta or anything else.
That this should happen most blatantly at the opening of the piece on the very word \quoted{acorde} is certainly meaningful.
The fifths do recall the tuning of the vihuela's strings (\quoted{cuerdas} being etymologically related to \quoted{acorde}), and of course fifths are perfect consonances.
But sung in sequence they remained in Cáseda's day the very paradigm of bad musicianship and untuneful composition.

Pedro Cerone specifically warned composers not to write passages that would tempt singers to add incorrect accidentals and \quoted{falsify} the music.
Cerone uses the terms \quoted{falsa} and \quoted{falsificar} at different times to mean either \term{musica ficta} or \quoted{wrong} notes (as in \quoted{false relations}).
In certain situations (of which he gives a notated example, shown in \cref{fig:Cerone-false-cadences}), \quoted{the singer can easily add a sharp to the fifth, thinking it to be a cadence [cláusula]: for he will see that the notes are moving in the manner of a cadence, saying \emph{Sol fa sol}, \emph{Re ut re}, and so on, and raising the note he will make it become false [falsa], and very dissonant to the ear}.%
	\autocite[629]{Cerone:Melopeo}

% %********************
% \begin{figure}
% 	\includeNarrowFigure{figures/Cerone-629-false-cadences}
% 	\caption{Melodic patterns \quoted{in danger of being falsified} (sung with improper ficta) in Cerone, \wtitle{El melopeo y maestro}, 629}
% 	\label{fig:Cerone-false-cadences}
% \end{figure}
% %********************

This is precisely the kind of passage Cáseda has written in his setting of \quoted{cláusulas varias}: the parts all have typical cadential patterns like the ones Cerone describes, and the voices would be tempted to raise certain pitches at the wrong times. 
As with the parallel fifths that Bermudo warned against, Cáseda appears to be breaking the rules deliberately and with symbolic intent.

Through his musical falsehoods, Cáseda has pushed the Neoplatonic theology of music to the point where earthly music, rather than attempting to reflect heavenly perfection, even if only partially, now overtly highlights its own falsehood.
The emphasis is shifting toward using music not to reflect heaven at all, but to aim primarily at \quoted{elevating the senses} and \quoted{dismaying the powers}---that is, the goal for the hearers is shifting from contemplation to affective experience.

Cáseda seeks affective impact through a new use of dissonance, in which dissonant intervals are highlighted rather than passed over, such that the emphasis of the music moves more toward creating tension than release.
To give one example, in \measures{6--7}, Cáseda uses the same kind of \quoted{Phrygian} cadence we have seen already in Cererols, Irízar, Bruna, and Ambiela.  % \X example
All these composers use the cadence (usually with the same seventh suspension as Cáseda has in the Tiple 2) at moments depicting heavenly music or music exceeding earthly understanding, and suggesting an affect of mystical transport.
Cáseda spices this up further by having the Alto anticipate the E\fl{} triad (\measures{6}, third note).
The senses are elevated here not by the perfection of sounding number, but by the depiction and enactment of human affects, using a developing set of affective topics.

This change need not be seen as part of a \quoted{disenchantment} process (as Hollander portrays it).
Rather, in order for Cáseda's flaunting of contrapuntal rules to have meaning, the rules must still be preserved.
Breaking them for expressive purposes (whether affective expression or symbolic expression, as of the Neoplatonic imperfection of \wtitle{musica instrumentalis}) actually reflects a continued faith in the validity of those rules.
Cáseda is not disregarding the old musical-theological system, but rather insisting upon it so strongly that he passes over a reasonable limit and seems to contradict himself.

%************************************************************
\section{Conclusions}

As the tradition of metamusical villancicos developed, there was an increased demand for composers both to imitate the conventions established by predecessors and to differentiate their own works in some way. 
At the same time the concept of imitation itself, as a musical-rhetorical practice within a Neoplatonic framework, was changing.
These chapters have argued that villancicos that featured \soCalled{singing about singing} began to change in function from emphasizing human music's similarity to heavenly music, toward emphasizing its difference; and toward a greater interest in expresssing and inciting human affects rather than reflecting divine order.
The three villancicos studied in this chapter demonstrate the first kind of imitation---that of influence and homage---because they manifest a certain degree of strain as each successive composer pushes the tradition of musical self-representation further towards a limit of intelligibility.

They also demonstrate the second type of imitation because their devotional topics suggest a shift in how villancicos in this subgenre functioned in religious life.
The examples by Padilla, Cererols, and Irízar provided listeners an opportunity to listen for heavenly music in the music of earth. 
They focused on music itself as a symbol of theological truths.
Carrión's \wtitle{Qué destemplada armonía}, by contrast, was less focused on abstract levels of music like the music of the spheres or the angels, and instead used human music-making as an analogy for the dynamics of repentance and faith.
The pieces in this chapter go further in this direction, partly because of their differing ritual functions.
Whereas the previous case studies were primarily Christmas pieces, the Bruna and Cáseda villancicos are for Eucharistic devotion, and the Ambiela is for Marian sanctoral devotion.
Contemplating the heavenly spheres and divine harmonies is less important in these pieces than the actual human act of worship through music.
