It seems appropriate in a study of historical theology to be frank about my own
personal relationship to the subject matter.
I am a Christian.
This means that I believe that the God who created the universe has redeemed me
from sin and death by taking on human flesh in the historic person of Jesus
Christ, suffering death on a cross and then rising again to new life on the
third day, and that the Spirit of God now lives in me and all other believers
and is working to give us ever-new and eternal life together with God; and that
the purpose of all of for all to share in the love that is God's nature.
I hope that most of the theologically educated people whose writings and
creations I have studied in this book would agree with at least most of the
preceding statement.
I am not a Roman Catholic, though I respect the Roman church and have learned
much from its liturgical and intellectual heritage.
In any case I am certainly not a person of the seventeenth-century Spanish
Empire: I do not believe in the authority of the pope or in purgatory any more
than I believe (as the people I study here did) that the earth is the center of
the universe or that the planets are arranged according to musical ratios and
influence the body through a balance of four humors.
As a Christian I may be inclined to take a more positive view of theology
generally, and perhaps as a non-Catholic I am actually less critical of the
Roman Church than I might be otherwise, as I have no skin in that game.
But for the same reason my own faith actually makes it clearer to me where I
would depart from these historical sources.
I am ashamed of the church's hypocrisy and corruption, especially its history
of justifying the subjugation of indigenous peoples and the enslavement of any
people, two problems which continue today.

Though I myself am a Christian believer I am not a Roman Catholic (I would say
I am an evangelical Methodist with some Lutheran leanings and a love for both
liturgical and contemporary forms of worship).

    Whether in the official Latin translation or the original Greek, the word for
    hearing (Latin \term{auditus}, \Greek \term{akoē}) can mean the faculty of
    hearing, the act of hearing, the hearing organ, or that which is heard.
    The New Revised Standard Version translates this \quoted{So faith comes from
    what is heard, and what is heard comes through the word of Christ}.
