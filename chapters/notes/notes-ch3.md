In an allegorical commentary on the liturgy, which was disseminated in
manuscript and print versions across the Hispanic world---including copies in
Puebla---Guillelmus Durandus called the whole time from the fall of Adam to the
birth of Christ, including the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness and
Babylonian captivity, the *tempus peregrinationis*.
[@Wright:Maze, 234]


[^estribillo-vs-emblems]:
This is a common practice in villancicos: a puzzling idea presented at the
beginning of the piece is not fully explained until the end of the coplas,
so that when the estribillo is then repeated, the listener can hear it with
new understanding.
^[ formal relationships here, diss p. 145 **XXX** ]
In many villancico poems, the relationship of estribillo and coplas is
similar to that between the image and accompanying texts in contemporary
emblem books (@Covarrubias:Emblemas).
In the emblem book of Covarrubias, the emblem is often striking but cryptic,
juxtaposing (for example) two well-known symbols in an unusual way, often
with a Latin motto.
On the facing page is a poem that expands on the ideas in the image, and on
the reverse of that page is a prose explanation of both the poem and the
image.
In this villancico text, then, the estribillo's function is similar to the
purpose of the emblem and poem as presenting attention-getting but enigmatic
symbols, while the coplas share the more explanatory function of the emblem
book's prose.
Just as one would read the explanation and then turn back to consider the
emblem again, now with a heightened sense of meaning, so too in the
villancico, when the estribillo is repeated after the coplas, listeners have
the opportunity to reconsider what they have heard in light of the coplas.
