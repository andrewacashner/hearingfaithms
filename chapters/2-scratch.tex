The catechism teaches that God communicated his own nature to humanity by taking on human flesh in Christ.
Therefore the true Word of God was not confined to Scripture or doctrines alone---the Word was a person, Jesus Christ, to whom the prophetic scriptures testified and from whom the Church's doctrine flowed.
In the words of John's gospel, Jesus Christ himself was the \term{logos} or \term{verbum} (\scripture{Jn 1:1}), the \quoted{Word made flesh}.
Where God had spoken through the law and the prophets, now he had spoken through his Son (\scripture{Heb 1:1}).
Christ called apostles and formed the church, and after his death, resurrection, and ascension this church was anointed by the Holy Spirit to continue communicating the divine Word to the world across the ages, through the legitimate succession of the church's ordained leaders.
The Word, then, was not a verbal formula to memorize or a concept to understand, but rather a person, made known through a community.
The church existed not only to proclaim the Word but to embody it, and new disciples of Christ, or catechumens, must seek to encounter Christ the Word through his embodied, sacramental presence in the community of the church.
For Roman Catholics, the church \emph{was} the gospel.
