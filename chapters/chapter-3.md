# Listening for Unhearable Music
`label:part:unhearable-music`

## Christ as Singer and Song
`label:ch:Padilla-Voces`

On Christmas Eve 1657 in colonial Puebla, the cathedral's tower bells had been
ringing for an hour when the first voices of the Christmas liturgy were sounded
at 11 p.m.
Having heard the summons, the cathedral chapter was joined by other clerics,
professors, landowners with their slaves, and common worshippers of every caste,
*indios*, *mestizos*, *mulatos*, and *criollos*, in a space glowing with
luminaries.
Whether they came out of habit or obligation, or in sincere devotion, there was
little else for them to do but listen.
Fortunately the chapter had ensured that its chapelmaster, Juan Gutiérrez de
Padilla, had prepared yet another sumptuous banquet of music, including chant
and Latin-texted polyphony both old and new.
The main attraction for many listeners, though, was the new set of villancicos.

As a cantor in Puebla Cathedral was intoning a Latin sermon of Pope St. Leo the
Great---the first reading in the second Nocturne of Matins---the musical chapel
was preparing to raise their own voices.
Holding handwritten notebooks with their individual performing parts for this
year's new cycle of villancicos, they looked to Father Padilla for their cue.
When the chanting concluded with a descending cadence, Padilla made sure the
chorus had the right starting pitches in their ears: he may have sung an
intonation, or had someone play a chord or short improvised cadence on the
organ.
He raised his hand and indicated the downbeat, the start of the metrical
*compás* or measure, and on one side of the double-choir ensemble, the three
voice parts (possibly three individual singers) of Chorus I entered on the
second beat, singing the word *Voces*.
The boy treble, adolescent alto, and tenor all sang this word high in their
registers, and the soft (*mollis*) harmony of the opening G minor chord hung
mysteriously in the vaulted space between the columns of the new cathedral's
architectural choir.
Moving in the same rhythm, following the natural accents of the poetry, the
voices declaimed this text like a solemn choral recitative (music example
`ref:music:Padilla-Voces-opening`):

> Voices of the chapel choir,\
> keep count with what is sung,\
> for the King is a musician,\
> and takes note of even the most venial dissonances,\
> after the manner of David the monarch,\
> just as in the manner of Jesus the infant prince.

\noindent
The other choir remained silent for these lines, as their notated parts
instructed them to heed the other chorus's admonition and "keep count" of
twenty-seven measures of rests until their entrance.

(insert music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-opening`)
`label:music:Padilla-Voces-opening`

Some of those closest to the voices had already seen the poem in the published
commemorative pamphlet; some of the seminary professors, perhaps, had even spent
some time with their students puzzling over its complex wordplay.
A few of them recognized the poem from an earlier, but slightly different,
version they had seen in an imported print of villancicos from Seville.
One of them may have even heard the Seville version in person.
These educated worshippers listened closely to hear how the chapelmaster, now
approaching his seventieth birthday and showing signs of age, would demonstrate
his mastery by realizing the poem's musical conceits in actual music.

The rest of the crowd heard and understood less, but recognized the opening
conceit of *voces*, and heard distinctly the phrase *que es músico el Rey* and
the references to David and *Jesús infante*.
As they looked past the choir to the newly decorated Altar of the Kings, filled
with images of Christ's birth and of celestial music, and as they heard the
solemn dialogue between choirs give way to more lively music, they worked to
imagine what sort of music the choir was singing about---the music of King
David with his lyre, the song of the Christmas angels, or the music they were
hearing this night in the heart of New Spain?

Thus begins a tour-de-force of music about music, in which the composer and his
ensemble take a verbal discourse about music and turn it into a musical
discourse about music.
This kind of discourse uses musical means to communicate something about music
itself---and here the subject is not only that made by human performance
(*musica instrumentalis*).
When the first chorus refers to "what is sung," they are not merely referring to
this literal level of human performance.
Instead, they point to *Jesús infante*---the child who is both the *infante* or
heir of the musician-king David and who is also God made flesh as an infant, a
child too young to be able to speak.

The next two chapters analyze and interpret two families of villancicos that
represent Christ as both singer and song, inviting hearers to listen for the
harmonies between earthly, heavenly, and divine forms of music.
The first is *Voces, las de la capilla*, set by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla
for Puebla Cathedral in 1657, which is connected to two other known settings of
similar texts.
The second is *Suspended, cielos, vuestro dulce canto*, one of the
best-attested families of villancicos, with eight documented settings of variant
poetic texts in the later seventeenth century; the one extant complete musical
setting is by Joan Cererols of the Abbey of Montserrat, around 1660.

These villancicos for Christmas connect incarnation, voice, and creation, as
they invite hearers to contemplate human music-making as a reflection of
Christ's nature as the divine "Word made flesh" (Jn 1).
Both textual traditions build on a patristic trope of Christ as
*Verbum infans*---the infant, or unspeaking Word.
Christ the Word does not need to speak because God is already communicating
himself to humankind through the Christ-child's incarnate body.
The villancicos set by Padilla and Cererols turn this into musical theology by
imagining the baby Jesus not speaking, but singing; and by considering Christ
himself as the song being sung.
Within the Spanish literary tradition of *conceptismo*, in which, under a
single governing conceit, a poem may be read in two or more ways simultaneously,
these metamusical pieces create a parallel discourse on music and theology by
playing on the rich symbolic heritage of musical words and concepts.
In the terms of Boethius, these pieces use *musica instrumentalis* to point
beyond themselves to higher forms of music---to the *musica humana*, the
harmony of body and soul, and of human society; *musica mundana*, the
harmony of the planetary and astral spheres; and even beyond the material world,
to the music of the *cielo Empyreo*.
In the Empyrean (English *Heaven* instead of *heavens* or sky), these
pieces evoke the song of saints and angels, and even the mysterious harmonies of
the Godhead: three persons in one Trinity, and the two natures of Christ as
man and God.

By tracing families and lineages of related villancicos on themes of heavenly
music, part `ref:part:unhearable-music` allows us to see how the musical
theology of villancicos developed over the course of the seventeenth century,
and the shifting ways that poets, composers, and listeners understood the
spiritual power of music to link hearing and faith.
The pieces interpreted in these case studies all challenge hearers to listen for
something more than human sounds; indeed, as these pieces reflect and reinforce
a Neoplatonic theology of music, they invite devotees to listen for unhearable
music, a music that defies human imagining, which creates harmony between the
human community and the divine.

Metamusical villancicos played a special role for Spanish composers as a kind of
self-imposed *oposición* or proof piece.
This type of piece offered them the opportunity to showcase their compositional
craft and theological insight.
By adapting poetry or music previously used by a teacher, predecessor, or rival,
a composer could stake out his place in a tradition that was both artistic and
theological.
On the artistic level composers developed tropes for musical
self-representation, vying with each other for the most overt, symbolically
meaningful, and moving displays of musical artifice.
As part of a theological tradition, the pieces on themes of heavenly music
manifest changing ways of thinking about the relationship between earthly music
and heavenly or divine music, in the midst of shifting early modern
understandings of the cosmos, the human body, and society.

These pieces connected faith and hearing by making Christ the Word audible
through poetic and musical structures; in fact they in a sense "incarnate" the
poetry and give it material form through musical performance in a specific place
and time.
The ingenuity of the structures suggests that the creators and performers of
these villancicos sought primarily not to teach doctrine, but to promote
doxology---glorifying God through contemplative devotion.
They invite listeners to respond to the mystery of the Incarnation in awe,
wonder, and adoration.  
They advocate and embody a Neoplatonic listening practice in which music points
beyond itself to a higher, unhearable music of heavenly truth.


### "Voices of the Chapel Choir" and the "Unspeaking Word"

The poem, whose author is unknown, is so elaborately contrived that it may seem
completely unintelligible at the first encounter (poem example
`ref:poem:Voces-Padilla`).
[@Cashner:WLSCM32, 37--38, 119--132; @Cashner:PhD, 133--203]
The piece demands a high level of intellectual engagement to tease out the
intricate conceit, and may thus be compared with what Bernardo Illari describes
as "enigma" villancicos.
[@Illari:Polychoral, vol. 2, 304--308]
Part of its difficulty comes from the widespread influence of the poetry of Luis
de Góngora, who played a similar role for Spanish literature on both sides of
the Atlantic to that of Giambattista Marino in Italian letters, as the
originator of a new aesthetic (referred to as *barroco* by Spanish literary
scholars) that emphasized learned artifice and highly wraught dramatic effects.
^[ as opposed to ... ]
Poets writing after the manner of Góngora reveled in arcane plays
on words, contorted Latinate syntax, and multiple levels of meanings.
[@Gaylord:Poetry, 222--236; @Tenorio:Gongorismo; @Valbuena:Literatura, vol. 1,
1014--1061]
This poem exemplifies the tradition of Spanish *conceptismo*, in which the poet
creates a sustained analogy between at least two different things such that the
understanding of each one informs the other.
Here the two elements are music---specifically the voices of choral
singing---and the Incarnate Christ at his birth.

(insert poem example `ref:poem:Voces-Padilla`)
`label:poem:Voces-Padilla`

The first of the two coplas provides a clear example of this technique.
One can read these two strophes solely on the one plane referring to Christ's
Incarnation and Passion, however elliptically.
In the first copla, the Christ-child gave a "wandering song" to the
Man---referring to the first man, Adam, being cast out of Paradise.  Christ
"went up so high" in "sustained tones of weeping"---suffering on the cross for
human redemption.
Christ "arose on the eighth" day---a traditional way of referring to the
Sunday on the Resurrection---"in the triune."
[See the entries for the numbers eight and three in @Bongo:NumerorumMysteria and
@Ricciardo:CommentariaSymbolica.]
Reading this copla according to the other side of the conceit, the Christ-child
gave the *tonus peregrinus* chant formula to the Man, and, as a virtuoso
singer, "he went up so high" that "in a cry of sharps," he
"went up the octave in a trill."

The poet has selected musical terms with double meanings that allow listeners
with musical knowledge to think about theological concepts in a new way, and
vice versa.
For example, the words *peregrino tono* could have called up for educated
listeners a tradition of using the chant *tonus peregrinus* to symbolize the
expectant wandering of sinful humanity waiting for the coming of Christ, as well
as concepts of the Christian life as a pilgrimage.
[This trope was developed through medieval sources like the allegorical
commentary on the liturgy of Guillelmus Durandus, whose works were available in
Puebla: @Wright:Maze, XXX.]
Cornelius à Lapide comments that Christ was born like a "pilgrim"
\[*peregrinus*\] on a journey in a borrowed stable, "in order to teach us to be
pilgrims on earth, though actually citizens of heaven."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 884, on Jn 1:14:
"Hoc est tentorium vel tabernaculum fixit in nobis, id est, inter nos, ad
modicum tempus, quasi hospes et peregrinus in terra aliena: erat enim ipse
civis, incola et dominus cœli ac paradisi";
@Lapide:Gospels19C, 669, on Lk 2:5: 
"ut doceret nos in terra esse peregrinos, cives vero cœli, ut ab hoc exilio
magnis virtutum passibus tendamis in cœlum, ceu patriam et civitatem nostram."]
The contemporary composer and theorist Andrés Lorente takes up the
"pilgrim song" trope, drawing on Vulgate Psalm 118:54, when he exhorts the
aspiring musician to match the music of his compositions with "the
spiritual Music of his person, cleansing his conscience, and rejoicing his soul
with Divine Music, so that he may say with David, *Cantabiles mihi erant
iustificationes tuæ in loco peregrinationis meæ* (Your right precepts have served
as songs for me in the place of my wanderings)."
[@Lorente:Porque, 609:
"la Musica espiritual de su persona, limpiando su conciencia, y alegrando su
Anima con Musica diuina, para que pueda dezir con Dauid, *Cantabiles mihi erant
iustificationes tuæ in loco peregrinationis meæ*."]
Within this tradition, then, the villancico uses a chant tone to present
Christ himself as the song given to sinful Man in his pilgrimage. 
In the musical setting, Padilla quotes the chant formula literally, so that the
symbol is present to the ear both in word and tone.

Before further analysis we should note that this poem is part of a family of
related texts, in a tradition in which texts were varied creatively for each new
musical setting; this interpretation is based on the particular version set by
Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla for Puebla in 1657.
We will focus first on the poem, but it is important to remember that this
version of the poem is only available in the musical partbooks, and the music 
shapes how we hear the poem even at a basic level of punctuation and the
structure of lines and strophes.

With an understanding of the poetic technique and its rich symbolic potential,
we may recognize that the central conceit of the poem is to link the "voices of
the chapel choir"---the actual sounding music being heard in the performance of
the villancico---with a higher, theological Music with a capital M, namely, the
Christ-child himself.
The poem evokes the musical voices of human singers, angelic choirs, ancient
prophets, and even the crying voice of the newborn Christ.
The second copla encapsulates the whole conceit: Christ is a divine musical
"composition," in which the divine chapelmaster "proves" his mastery at creating
"consonances of a Man and God."
In the *introducción*, it would seem that the "chapel" is performing before the
king, like the Spanish *Capilla Real*; and this King, that is, God, "is a
musician."
His only-begotten son---his royal *infante*---is this divine chapelmaster's
*oposición* or proof piece, in which he demonstrates his mastery by creating
concord between opposed elements.
Christ brings together infinite and finite ("maxima and breve"), and creates a
consonance to restore the discordant relationship between sinful Man and the
holy God by reconciling both in his own body.

<!-- XXX line refs -->

On the theological side of the conceit, who exactly is this king who is
listening so carefully to the chapel choir's voices?
The poet explicitly connects the king to "David the monarch," the paragon
of Biblical musicians as both the traditional author of the psalms and as the
founder of the first musical ensemble for worship in the ancient Hebrew
temple.
^[ source ]
Calling Jesus *infante* identifies this child as David's heir---that is, as the
Messiah; and the phrase *a lo de* (in the manner or style of) suggests that this
child will be no less exacting a musical taskmaster than his ancestor.

It only becomes clear later in the poem that the word *infante* also points to
another theological trope based on the double meaning of the Latin word *infans*
as both infant and "unable to speak."
In this tradition, the Christ-child is *Verbum infans*---the "unspeaking Word,"
who does not need to speak because he himself *is* the Word.
This villancico's conceit treats both the Word and the child in musical terms,
so that Christ as the incarnate Word is a musical composition; and so
that the child is depicted not as speaking but, through his cries, as
singing---making Christ both singer and song.

As the poem continues, it presents Christ as the theological fulfillment of the
prophecies made to and through David, especially the psalms. 
In musical terms, Christ's life "is putting notes to his lyrics" (ll. 8--9), and
thus his life is recounted cryptically with the technical vocabulary for
describing a musical composition or performance.
Theologically, God had promised to David an heir to sit on his throne forever
and deliver his people, <!-- cites -->
and through Isaiah the prophet he renewed this promise by saying that a child
would be born "upon whose shoulder" would rest the "key" of divine, eternal
authority (Is. 22:22).
As Biblical interpreters of the time all agreed, the complete fulfillment of
these prophecies, the culmination of all God's "centuries of heroic exploits"
(l. 8) came not at Christ's birth, but at his death and resurrection,
traditionally thirty-three years (and three months and three days) later.
^[ mention "A que el juego" which also uses thirty-three ]
In musical terms, the words of David and the prophets are just the lyrics;
Christ's life is the song.
The key of authority---*clave*---is the same word for clef; and it
awaits "the thirty-three," suggesting some kind of musical measure.

The second section of the introduction (ll. 11--16) depicts the moment of
Christ's birth as a musical performance.
This happens "years before the sign, 'dexterity in hope'."
Since the poet has just referred to "the thirty-three" as a metonym for
Christ's passion, the *divisa*---a sign of any kind but particularly a
heraldic device or motto---may refer to the cross, or to Christ himself, whom
the angel in Luke 2 calls a *signum* (sign) to the shepherds, and whom Simeon
tells Mary will be a "sign that will be spoken against."
^[ source ]
The motto, *la destreza en la esperanza*, sounds like a gloss of a phrase from
the Roman historian Tacitus, *spes in virtute, salus ex victoria*, used to
describe a desperate moment in Caesar's battle against the Germanic tribes on
the Elbe, in which "valour was their only hope, victory their only safety."
^[Tacitus, *Annals* II:20, in the translation by Alfred John Church and William
Jackson Brodribb XXX proper citation]
The vocabulary here (*hazañas*, *destreza*, *divisa*) marks Christ as a heroic
warrior-king in a style that resonated with the military-influenced culture of
early modern Spain; here again he follows after his ancestor David the
giant-killer.
This description also fits with the liturgical lessons of Christmas Matins from
Pope St. Leo the Great that characterize Christ's birth as the beginning of a
battle with the devil.
^[ XXX Azevedo on hazañas and Leo in the liturgy]
The word *destreza* was also used to signify musical virtuosity, especially
compositional ingenuity.
The *divisa* could be a musical sign as well such as a meter signature.
players and for composers.
^[XXX  source ]

In the next lines we begin to hear this musician's song, and the theological and
musical come too close to cleanly separate.
The solmization syllables *sol* and *mi* here indicate musical pitches, as well
as the symbolic puns on "sun" and "me."
The "Gloria" of the angelic choirs begins "on *sol*," as many Gregorian *Gloria
in excelsis* chants do; it also begins "with the sun," a reference both to
Christ's birth traditionally at midnight ("at the half-measure of night", l. 15)
and a symbol of his royalty, the same symbol used by Spain's own king, Philip
IV.
^[XXX  cite also Is. 60:1, connect Jn 1:14, Tit 2:11 ]

The linked terms "grace" and "glory" also refer to a theological tradition that
links the *Gloria* of the Christmas angels to the grace offered to humanity
through Christ's Incarnation, and to the glory awaiting the redeemed when they
join the angels in heaven.
As Lapide epitomizes this concept, discussed at length also by Augustine in
connection with Rom. 5:1--2, the terms correspond to the "two-fold" nature of
man's "supernatural life": by grace being justified in order to serve God, and
in glory consummated to enjoy God forever. 
"Grace, therefore, is the seed of glory, and in turn glory is the consummation
of grace." 
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 878, on Jn 1:4:
"In verbo quasi in fonte et cause primiginia erat vita nostra supernaturalis,
puta gratiæ et gloriæ, ideoque ut hanc vitam nobis impetraret, incarnatus est et
factus homo, ut initio dixi.
Supernaturalis enim vita est duplex: inchoata per gratiam, qua homo justus per
fidem, spem et charitatem servit Deo, vivitque vitam supernaturalem, in Deum
supernaturaliter credendo, sperando, eumque super omnia amando: altera vita
supernaturalis est consummata per gloriam, qua Beati Deo fruntur, deliciantur et
beantur in æternum."
Cf. @Augustine:SermonesPL, 98, Sermo 185, In Natali Domini 2.]

Now the poet turns even more strongly from using music as a metaphor to
describing actual music-making.
The estribillo brings together the whole creation of humans, animals (*hombres y
brutos*, l. 20; also the reference to birdsong in l. 16), heavenly spheres (*las
distancias*, a technical term in both astronomy and music), all joining with the
angels in the chorus to praise God made Incarnate in their midst.
Like all poetry about music, this representation of music draws on the poet's
experience of actual, contemporary music---thus the spheres sing "in one
choir and the other," like Spain's polychoral ensembles.

The numbers here ("three by three, two by two, one by one") have a wide
range of possible symbolic meanings, while at the most literal level (the level
Padilla seizes on in his setting) it describes the number of voices in the
musical texture.
"Two by two" would seem to be a reference to the animals on Noah's Ark,
here referring not only to the animals in the stable, but also to the whole
scene as a picture of the Christian church, a symbolic connection going back to
the first century.
^[XXX  cite 1 Peter, Augustine ]
"Three by three" could be the nine ranks of angelic choirs, and
"one by one" could refer to humans or to Christ himself (particularly his
union of divine and human in a single body).
^[XXX  ? cite 9-fold angel choir ]

Thus far the poet has directed the listener's (reader's) ear from attending to
the chapel choir singing in the present, to the ancient temple choir of David
and the voices of prophets through the centuries, and up to the moment when the
angels led the song of Gloria at Christ's birth.
But all these voices, the poem now says, have been "awaiting the
opportune time, the one who was before all time" (ll. 24--25).
The true music of Christmas is Christ himself, and thus the next lines represent
the voice of the baby Jesus.
The musical imagery here continues the conceit of the King as musician, a
*padre* (father, priest) like most Spanish chapelmasters including Padilla.
He either sounds the pitch *A (la, mi, re)* in Guidonian solmization with
his voice as a tuning note (the same one used today), or sings an intonation on
that note as a cantor would do.
Another translation of the contorted syntax here might suggest that the poetic
speaker actually "heard the voice of the Father singing," that is,
*through* the voice of the child.
This could also be a reference to the heavenly voice heard at Christ's baptism
(Mt. XXX).
At this cue, the speaker says, he heard singing (or a song *cantar*), not in
*puntos de canto llano* (plainchant) but *puntos de llanto* (weeping).
This connects Christ's cries at his birth with those at his death (Mk. XXX).
The song is "as much to be seen (or admired) as to be heard"---because the song
and the singer are one and the same.

This interpretation depends on reading "the sign of *A (la, mi, re)*" as a
symbol of Christ himself.
The poem says the voices were all awaiting "the one who was before all time," an
appositive phrase referring to Christ, whom the Nicene Creeds declares was
"begotten of the father before all ages \[*secula*\]".
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 42: "ex patre natum ante omnia secula."]
The reference to Christ's eternal existence together with the letter A recalls
Christ's description of himself in the Revelation to John as "*alpha* and
*omega*"---the Vulgate simply puts the Greek letter α here.[^alpha-omega]
This title indicates that Christ is "the beginning and the end," "the one who is
and who was and who is to come" (Rev. 1:8, 21:6, 22:13).[^Rev1-8]
The time symbolism works on a musical level as well, but the "sign of A" also
suggests the musical pitch A.
As will be argued below, the phoneme *a* (pronounced *ah*) also evokes the
wordless cry of the baby Jesus as a form of music.

[^alpha-omega]:
This is an especially interesting choice since the Greek text of
Rev. 1:8 actually spells out *alpha* (but not *omega*).

[^Rev1-8]:
In both Greek and Latin, the phrase in Revelation 1:8 repeats exactly
the words used for the name of God (the Hebrew tetragrammaton, *YHWH*) in
the translations of Ex. 3:14 into those languages (Greek ὡ ων, Latin *qui est*).

The final couplet epitomizes the theology of Incarnation through a play on
rising and falling musical lines: "Everything in Man is to ascend/ and
everything in God is to descend" (ll. 32--33).
This is a musical version of a common summary of the Incarnation as an exchange
between God and man.
As Lapide puts it, Christ "lowered himself to the earth and flesh, in order to
lift us up to heaven. 'Therefore,' says St. Anselm, 'God was made man, in order
that man might be made God.'"
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 670, on Lk. 2:7:
"Depressit se in terram et carnem, ut nos eveheret in cœlum. *Ideo*, ait S.
Anselm, *Deus factus est homo, ut homo fieret Deus*."]
This central theology of Christianity is represented in the poem through the
musical concept of a contrapuntal voice exchange.

The villancico began by drawing listeners' attention to the voices of Christmas,
and exhorting the singing voices of the chapel choir to take note of their own
singing while also listening for "what is sung" on a higher level.
The piece connects Christ and David as musician-kings, with Christ as the song
that puts the prophetic "lyrics" of David and other Scriptural authors to
music.
After long waiting, at the "opportune time," Christ was born into the world to
begin a battle "in hope," a virtuoso performance fulfilled in his death and
resurrection at "the thirty-three," upon the "sign" of the cross.
Christ himself is the incarnate Word, and his infant cries are the true "sign of
A," the "song" that sets the tone for all the other voices, "in one choir and
another" of the Christmas manger, and at the Christmas liturgy in the
present-day of the villancico's performance.

### Music about Music in the Voices of Puebla's Chapel Choir

The poem sets up a chain of echoes, in which what God spoke through the voices of
David and the other prophets reverberates in the song of the angels at the first
Christmas and especially the voice of the Christ-child; and where all this
resounds through the actual "voices of the chapel choir" in the present day.
When Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla "puts notes to his lyrics," he uses his
compositional ingenuity, and calls upon the virtuosity of his performers, to
turn a series of poetic conceits *about* music into actual sounding music that
worshippers could hear.  
Listeners whose ears were well trained spiritually and musically could discern
the higher levels of music through the sounding forms.

Padilla crafts musical structures that clearly project the formal structure of
the poem at the levels of grammar, phrasing, and metrical patterns.
He projects the words clearly according to their prosody and grammatical
structure, and sets them to memorable melodic and rhythmic patterns.
This approach fits with an aesthetic of Tridentine clarity in presenting the
text, as well as with traditions from Spanish popular and theatrical traditions
of singing poetry, especially traditions of adapting stock melodic formulas for
singing *romance* poetry.
^[XXX  cite ]
The composer also depicts the meaning of the words through musical symbols and
figures that correspond to concepts and imagery in the text (i.e.,
"madrigalisms").
In addition, he uses different stylistic registers and topics (that is,
allusions to other pre-existing styles of music) to further both projection and
depiction, as well as to instill an affective experience in the listener that
matches with the goals of the poem.

The large-scale structure of the setting highlights the distinct sections of the
poem.
The poem begins with an introductory section, which will be useful to label
*introducción* as many poetry imprints of other villancicos do.
The *introducción* consists of two six-line strophes, each followed by the
same *respuesta* or response of a four-line strophe.
The placement of rests and repeat markings in the performing parts makes clear
that the *respuesta* is sung after each of the six-line strophes.
^[XXX  distinguish from other edition, performance ]
An *estribillo* follows, which is repeated after the two *coplas*.

The piece's harmonic structure helps articulate the form of the poem.
The piece is in mode I, in *cantus mollis*---that is, the one flat in the
key signature transposes the mode up a fourth; the final is on G and the Tenor
parts have a mostly authentic ambitus.
The internal cadences in the *introducción* are on G (m. 19), D (m. 27), and G
(m. 44); and the cadences at the end of the estribillo and of both coplas are
also on G.
These cadence points are in line with the prescriptions of contemporary
theorists for modal counterpoint, while also punctuating the sections of the
poem and making its grammatical and rhetorical structure clear to listeners.
^[XXX  cte diss. 164 Cerone, Judd, Barnett ]

The composer has paid close attention to both metrical patterns and details of
accentuation and diction.  
Padilla begins the piece with the voices of the first choir moving together
rhythmically to declaim the words in something like choral recitative.
For this poetry in *romance* meter, Padilla has the singers declaim the
eight-syllable lines in pairs, with emphasis on the assonant even-numbered
lines.  
^[XXX  cite metrica, crestomatia, romance publications, Old English, German exx]
Padilla's setting aurally projects the text as though it were arranged like
similar ballad forms in Germanic poetry---as sixteen-syllable lines, with a
*caesura* in the middle and assonance at the end, like this:

-----------------------------   ---------------------------
Voces, las de la capilla,       cuenta con lo que se canta,
que es músico el rey, y nota    las más breves disonancias
a lo de Jesús infante           y a lo de David monarca.
-----------------------------   ---------------------------

\noindent
Padilla sets the first two lines of poetry (mm. 1--10) with relatively long note
values on the stressed syllables, creating a deliberate, careful tone that
embodies the poetic exhortation to "pay attention" to what is sung.
He has the singers pause briefly where the *caesurae* would be, but punctuates
the assonant lines with clear points of harmonic arrival.
He articulates the end of the strophes in the *introducción* with full
cadences.

The first chorus sings the first word, *Voces*, beginning on the second
subdivision of the ternary measure, with three minims for the first syllable and
two for the second.
Since the word ends on S and is an invocation, it would make sense to have the
singers make a small break between mm. 2--3, placing the S sound on the last
minim of m. 2 or just after.
This allows the word to be sung in a way that matches the natural quantities of
its two syllables and that projects its grammatical structure in the opening
sentence of the poem.
That first word, in a common device of Padilla's villancicos, is sung on the
second minim of the measure: thus the leader could conduct the downbeat, cueing
the singers to breathe, and then the chorus would sing their entrance, which
because of its high tessitura and irregular, offbeat rhythms, seems suspended in
the air.
The word *cuenta* (m. 6) is also sung on the second minim of the measure and is
then held for three minims, syncopated across the downbeat.
After this long not, like pulling back a spring, the metrical pattern is
released and the voices flow in even, regularly accented minims on *con lo que
se canta*.
For the next phrase (*que es músico el rey*) Padilla creates the effect of an
interjection, breaking the rhythmic pattern and beginning this phrase, like the
others, on the second minim of the measure.

The rest of Padilla's setting is as meticulously crafted as this opening phrase
on the level of text projection.
Another example is the interjection *¡O qué canto!*, which Padilla starts on the
last minim of the measure before the previous phrase has finished, exactly as an
interjection should.
His setting of the estribillo is more madrigalistic---that is, more driven by
text depiction---but still closely follows the natural accentuation patterns of
the poetry.
Aside from the symbolic meanings of the two changes of meter (m. 45 and m. 60;
see below), these shifts match the stress patterns implicit in these sections of
poetry.

It is on the level of text depiction---representing the meaning of the text
through musical figures and symbols---that Padilla demonstrates his full mastery
of his craft by presenting an intricate discourse about music through music
itself.
As we have noted, the opening invocation to the "Voices of the chapel
choir, keep count with what is sung" is voiced by one division of the polychoral
ensemble while the other chorus literally counts its rests until its entrance in
the *respuesta*.
The first chorus sings the word *cuenta* on a long, offbeat note, a
blackened, dotted semibreve (that is, artificially perfected) that leaps off the
page as a visual indication to the singer to "keep count," and makes a
clear audible symbol as well.
Padilla sets "the lightest dissonance" in mm. 14--19 by having the
Altus I suspend across the first minim of m. 18, making a dissonant
seventh against the Tenor's A---this forms a light dissonance that quickly
resolves to F sharp and then to a cadence on G in m. 19.
On the repeat of this section, it is easy to imagine that an experienced treble
singing about "the trills of the dawn" in mm. 25--27 would have improvised a
trill on the suspension at this cadence.
[See Cerone's isntructions for improvisng ornaments at cadences,
-@Cerone:Melopeo, 545--546.] 
In the *respuesta*, where Chorus II sings about awaiting "the thirty-three,"
Padilla writes precisely thirty-three pitches for both of the sung vocal parts.

Where the poem says that the whole world was "waiting" for "the
sign"---that is, the Incarnate Christ---in Padilla's setting, that sign comes
with the estribillo in m. 45, where the C meter sign indicates a shift
to duple meter, after which the musicians shift from the declamatory style of
the introduction to a more regular rhythmic pattern, moving together in
*corcheas* (modern eighth notes).
Here Padilla depicts what the words say by building up a point of imitation
"from one choir to the other" (mm. 45--50) and then creating
polychoral dialogue (mm. 51--59).
Padilla sets the numbers in the poem literally: three performers for
*tres a tres*, two for *dos a dos*, and one for *uno a uno*.

The style of this section, contrasting with that of the introduction, is like
that of a madrigal (music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-madrigal`).
This section, then, is "music about music" in yet another sense, as Padilla refers
to other genres and styles of music within one villancico.
As the poem depicts the actual singing performed at the first Christmas, Padilla
uses a style that evokes and embodies convivial group singing.
The angels, planets, shepherds, and animals around the créche are represented
not only as singing in the abstract---they are singing a madrigal.

In fact, the play on numbers, "three by three" and so on, seems like a direct
reference to the madrigal *As Vesta Was from Latmos Hill Descending* by Thomas
Weelkes (published in Thomas Morley's collection *The Triumphes of Oriana* in
1601).
Weelkes's music, and that of other English madrigalists, did circulate in
Iberia: his madrigals, and possibly this specific collection, were included
along with Italian madrigals in the 1649 catalog of the music collection of
Portuguese King João (John) IV in Lisbon.
[@JohnIV:Catalog, no. 559, 584]
It therefore seems plausible that this repertoire was also known in Spain
(where Padilla lived into his 30s) and possibly Spanish America.
As we will argue below, Padilla's villancico text appears to be based on an
earlier piece performed in Lisbon, a setting of which was also part of João's
collection.
Even without this specific connection, Padilla's approach to matching music to
words in the estribillo depicts the words' meaning in a manner that any musician
of the time would have identified with madrigals.

(insert music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-madrigal`)
`label:music:Padilla-Voces-madrigal`

Padilla's musical scene matches contemporary Nativity images that portray
music-making around the manger.
Padilla's Andalusian compatriot Francisco de Zurbarán depicted two levels of
music in his *Adoration of the Shepherds*, painted for the high altar of the
Carthusian monastery of Jerez de la Frontera in 1638--1639
(figure `ref:fig:Zurbaran-Jerez-Adoracion`).
In heaven above, angels sing to the accompaniment of the harp, while below,
another angelic consort joins the company of worshippers in the stable, and they
sing to the accompaniment of the lute.
In Spain the harp was associated with both heavenly music and earthly church
music (see chapter `ref:ch:Zaragoza`), and the lute, with musical genres
performed outside of church, such as the madrigal.
Villancicos crossed both domains, and therefore could incorporate references to
both styles within them---much as Zurbarán's painting incorporates aspects of
genre painting, the representation of earthy details from everyday life, into a
representation of sacred history.
[@Sanchez:Zurbaran, 31; @Cherry:Bodegon; @Haraszti-Takacs:Genre]
Both visual and musical forms of crossover were especially fitting to represent
the Christmas moment when the "maxima" and "breve," high and low, were brought
together, and the music of the heavenly chorus broke through to be heard by
humble shepherds.

(insert figure `ref:fig:Zurbaran-Jerez-Adoracion`)
`label:fig:Zurbaran-Jerez-Adoracion`

Additionally, Zurbarán's image,  includes a bound lamb next to the manger as a
symbol of Christ's fate as the paschal lamb, much as "the thirty-three" and
other references in this villancico connect Christ's birth to his sacrificial
death.
The same trope is present may be seen in the manger scene in a 1613 Roman
Breviary and the Adoration of the Shepherds on the retable of Puebla Cathedral
(figure `ref:fig:Puebla-Ferrer-Pastores`, discussed below).
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, 168]

By referencing different levels of musical style, Padilla maps contrasting types
of human music onto the contrast of earthly and heavenly music.
The phrase *grave, suave y sonoro* seems to have been a stock description of
sacred music appropriate for liturgical worship.
^[ XXX cite Lorena Uribe Bracho on *suave* and vocabulary of music in 17c
poetry]
The same words are used to describe the music of Christ as a musician (in fact,
as a musical instrument) in José de Cáseda's *Qué música divina* from a
half-century later, as discussed in chapter `ref:ch:Zaragoza`.
A bequest to Mexico City Cathedral in XXX used nearly identical terms to
describe the Latin Responsories that should be sung.
Interestingly, in that case the term was used to specify Latin-texted music
*as opposed to* villancicos.
^[XXX  cite Goldman, check detail ]
Here, within a villancico, the term is used to refer to a higher form of
music-making, within the Neoplatonic tradition of using that which is lowly to
point toward higher truths.

At the phrase *y aguardan tiempo oportuno* ("and they await the opportune time,"
m. 60), Padilla shifts meter signatures again, returning to ternary meter (CZ)
with a new lilting rhythmic pattern.
This creates a sense of arrival in a new *tiempo*, which then abruptly halts at
the end of the phrase, *quien antes del tiempo fue* ("the one who was before
time", mm. 63--65).
As Christ is "the beginning and the end" (Rev. XXX), this halt is fitting.
Lorente says the term *tiempo* can denote the meter and the symbol that sets the
meter.[@Lorente:Porque, bk. 2, 149]
Thus, since Christ existed before all time theologically, Padilla puts this
phrase "before the time signature" musically.

The musical conceipts in the next lines of poetry shift the focus from rhythm to
melody, as the poem uses solmization symbols: *por el signo a la mi re, puestos
los ojos en mi*.
Likewise, Padilla's metamusical conceits play on the musical terms in the most
literal sense, realizing the solmization syllables in several ways at the same
time (music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-alamire`).
Both Altus I and Tenor I sing the word *a* on the pitch *A (la, mi, re)* (m.
67).
On the words *la mi re* (mm. 68--69), the Tiple I sings the pitches D--C♯--D: in
the soft hexachord the D would in fact be *la*; then the written sharp on C
would alter it to a *mi* in *musica ficta*; and the final D could be *re* in the
natural hexachord.
On the same words, the Tenor sings D--A--D: *la--mi* in the soft hexachord, then
*re* in the natural hexachord.
At the end of this phrase (m. 72), the performers of all three voices sing the
word *mi* by literally "putting their eyes on *mi*, with Tiple and Tenor on A
(*mi* in the soft hexachord) and Altus on E (*mi* in the natural hexachord).

(insert music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-alamire`)
`label:music:Padilla-Voces-alamire`

Guidonian solmization was still a fundamental part of Spanish theory treatises
through the eighteenth century, and were used frequently enough that they came
to be used as the Spanish names for pitch-classes in the seven-note scale.
The prevalence of solmization practice is evidenced by both books intended for
specialists (Cerone) and those for beginners, such as the 1677 guitar primer of
Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz, as well as student notebooks in manuscript.
[@Ruiz:Luz; examples of manuscript student notebooks are in E-Bbc: M732/13--16;
see also @Cohen:NotesMiddleAges]
Even if fully trained singers did not often resort to the actual syllables in
reading music, they were trained in the system and could certainly have
recognized the Guidonian puns in this passage.

The next phrase evokes both singing and listening---*a la voz del padre oí cantar
por puntos de llanto* (I heard the father's voice singing in weeping
tones)---and on "I heard" (m. 77), all the voices cadence and then rest, as
though to stop and listen.
To create the effect of the interjection *¡O, qué canto!*, Padilla has the
second chorus enter on the last minim of the measure (m. 83), before the first
chorus has finished their phrase.
We might speculate that the emphatic *O* in the succeeding passage may be
intended to contrast with the *signo A (la, mi, re)*, marking Christ as *alpha*
and *omega*.

In the final couplet of the estribillo (*Todo en el hombre es subir/ y todo en
Dios es bajar*, mm. 100--126), as the full chorus evokes the theological concept
of God's descent and humankind's ascent through the Incarnation, Padilla creates
a matching musical concept of contrasting ascending and descending gestures with
opposed rhythmic profiles.
In the first gesture, for Man ascending, the voices ascend stepwise in minims,
in a lilting ternary dotted rhythm.
this is first heard in Altus I and Tenor I, mm. 98--100, with the ascent
highlighted by having the Tenor move through F sharp.
In rhetorical terms this is *anabasis*.
In the second gesture, for God descending, all the voices move
downwards---*catabasis*---in emphatic duple rhythm with blackened semibreves,
including passing through added E flats (Chorus I, mm. 100--104).
The Tenor I has the highest number of blackened notes, singing a sequence of
descending fourths (mm. 100--103), then thirds (mm. 108--112), and finally
seconds (mm. 118--122) (figure `ref:fig:Padilla-Voces-TI-bajar`).

(insert figure `ref:fig:Padilla-Voces-TI-bajar`)
`label:fig:Padilla-Voces-TI-bajar`

When Padilla juxtaposes these ideas in the full polychoral texture, listeners
can hear the fusion of both rising and falling melodic lines, and two different
rhythmic systems---the duple-compound *sesquialtera* rhythm of "Man ascending"
and the triple-simple rhythm of "God descending" (music example
`ref:music:Padilla-Voces-subir_bajar`).
In the final cadence, the Altus I combines the two gestures at once by singing
the words "everything in God is to descend" to the music associated with "Man
ascending" (mm. 124--126).
The passage embodies the central theology of the Incarnation: through God's
descent to become Man in Christ, Man may ascend to share in God's nature.
^[XXX  patristic sources for this ]

(insert music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-subir_bajar`)
`label:music:Padilla-Voces-subir_bajar`

Each of the two poetic coplas centers on a concept from music theory: the first
plays with the notion of *peregrino tono* ("wandering song," or the plainchant
*tonus peregrinus*); the second, on the contrasting rhythmic values of *la
máxima y breve*.
True to form, Padilla sets *peregrino tono* to a fragment of the actual
plainchant tone.
The last psalm tone was known in Latin sources as the *tonus peregrinus* and in
Spanish sources as *tono irregular* or *tono mixto*.
Its final cadence is a rising minor third followed by a stepwise descent to the
final (figure `ref:fig:Cerone-tonus_peregrinus`).
^[XXX  p. 354) ]
In *cantus durus* this is D--F--E--D; if notated in the *cantus mollis*
transposition of this villancico, the pitches would be G--B♭--A--G, which are
exactly what the Altus I sings on these words (mm. 128--129, music example
`ref:music:Padilla-Voces-peregrino_tono`).
<!-- or medial cadence, match with example -->
The same motive of the a leap up followed by a descending third is then imitated
in the Tenor I and Tiple I on F--E--D, the *durus* version.
^[XXX  cautionary F# as "strange tone"? ]

(insert figure `ref:fig:Cerone-tonus_peregrinus`)
`label:fig:Cerone-tonus_peregrinus`

(insert music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-peregrino_tono`)
`label:music:Padilla-Voces-peregrino_tono`

In the last phrase of this copla, when the poem speaks of Christ "going up the
octave" or theologically "ascending on the eighth day", Padilla creates an
octave ascent across the voices, with the Tenor leaping D~4~--G~4~ and the Tiple
continuing, G~4~--D~5~.
This octave also plays into the symbolism of the *tonus peregrinus*, since
Cerone says that Spanish writers call this "eighth" psalm tone *octavo
irregular*.[@Cerone:Melopeo, 354]

The second copla emphasizes rhythm, using the *máxima* and *breve*, in medieval
theory the longest and shortest note values, to point to the union of eternal
and temporal, infinite and finite in the incarnate Christ as the divine
chapelmaster's "composition."
Padilla presents the basic concept of long versus short note values through the
lengthened note on *máxima* in the Tenor (mm. 153--154) over a long held note
in the Bassus (mm. 154--155).
Ironically, each of these long notes is actually a breve (music example
`ref:music:Padilla-Voces-maxima`).
How better to express the unity between these opposites than by vocalizing the name
for one while singing the value of the other?
The Altus echoes with a blackened semibreve (mm. 154--155), which in this
context is a long note made shorter, getting at the same concept a different
way.
At a more arcane level, the whole first phrase of this copla (mm. 147--156) is
ten measures (*compases*) long, which is precisely equal to the length of a true
maxima plus a breve (that is, eight measures in C3 plus two measures).

(insert music example `ref:music:Padilla-Voces-maxima`)
`label:music:Padilla-Voces-maxima`

Padilla's setting as a whole is intimately connected to the sound and meaning of
the poetry.
Padilla has his chapel choir present the poem in a way that allows the words to
be heard clearly, reflecting their grammatical structure and the poem's dramatic
shape, while also embodying the conceits of the poetry in appropriate musical
symbols and even adding some musical puzzles of his own.
The contrasting styles in the piece would also work on a less intellectual, more
experiential level, to move the affections of hearers.

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

### Theology of Christ as *Verbum infans*

By inviting hearers to listen for the voice of *Jesús infante*, Padilla's piece
presents a new twist on a trope that extends back to Bernard of Clairvaux and
further to Augustine---that of Christ as *Verbum infans*, "the unspeaking/infant
Word."
This trope continued to be turned and refined through the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and can be found in Christmas sermons and exegetical
commentaries on the Gospel infancy narratives that were widely available in
Padilla's day and that would have been familiar to a university-educated priest.
The feast of Christmas centered on devotion to the incarnation of Christ as a
child, the "Word made flesh"; this piece of devotional music presents a poetic
and musical discourse on Christ's incarnation by conceiving of "the Word" in
musical terms and then representing that concept in actual music.

#### The Christmas Imaginary

The Puebla congregation heard this piece in the context of the festival of
Christmas, and its theological trope of the *Verbum infans* is best understood
as an expression of the devotional attitudes that characterized this feast.
Christmas had first developed from regionally varying annual celebrations of
Christ's birth and beginnings, and solidified as a formal observance among the
church communities of fourth-century Rome.
[@Talley:LiturgicalYear, 85--140; @Bradshaw:EarlyWorship, 86--89;
@Roll:OriginsChristmas]
The customary readings and chants from Scripture developed alongside the other
customs of Christmas throughout the medieval period.
While it may be more conventional to label these traditions "doctrines" or
"dogmas" (particularly after Trent), they represent more than officially
codified propositions.
Rather, the tropes of Christmas include not only doctrinal concepts like the two
natures of the incarnate Christ as divine and human, but extend also to
attitudes, affects, frames of mind---all the cultural practices that go into
making the festival "feel like Christmas."
It is more helpful for understanding devotional culture if we treat the term
*orthodoxy* as including not only "right belief" but also the whole complex of
mental convictions, emotional attitudes, and social, bodily practices that form
the "proper ways of worshipping" as understood within a particular religious
community.[^feasts-and-seasons]

[^feasts-and-seasons]:
@Grimes:Beginnings, 54--62, identifies distinct but interlinked ritual modes of
"liturgy" and "celebration."
Scholars of ritual studies and Christian liturgical theology have consistently
argued that liturgy does more than promulgate doctrines, but musicological and
philological studies of post-Tridentine religious arts have not always paid
enough attention to the insights of these fields.
For an influential modern Catholic theology of the function of liturgical
feasts, see @Taft:LiturgicalYear, 3--4, 12--23.

These tropes contributed to what might be called a Christmas imaginary, the
contents of which one may see restated and endlessly varied not only in
villancicos but also painted and sculpted on Spanish church walls and printed in
the text and illustrations of contemporary theological books.
The visual and performing arts preserved in such historic sources represent only
a portion of the lively variety of customary social practices connected with the
feast---gift-giving, traditional foods, popular songs from oral tradition.
both official sources like the liturgy, creeds, catechisms, commentaries, and
homilies as well as unofficial popular devotion drew from and contributed to a
commmon fund of Christmas tropes, which by the seventeenth century was filled to
overflowing.
The function of early modern Catholic feasts was not so much to teach people
that Christ *is* something, as to cultivate to devotion to Christ *as*
something.
In theological terms, the primary goal was doxology, not indoctrination.

Padilla's villancico was performed in the midst of these Scriptures and
patristic preaching, as well as contemporary preaching in the vernacular; it
should be understood as amplifying, extending, and even playing with the
Christmas tropes in those other sources.
Though oral tradition was probably still the most important force in cultivating
the Christmas imaginary in early modern Spain, printed theological literature
disseminated and reinforced these tropes in Padilla's day and makes them
accessible today.
The large number of compendia of patristic commentaries on Scripture and model
sermons preserved from Puebla's seminary and convent libraries provide evidence
for the high level of learning among New Spanish clergy and documents their
spiritual formation (table `ref:table:puebla-compendia`).

(insert table `ref:table:puebla-compendia`)
`label:table:puebla-compendia`

The Christmas liturgy provided the foundation for the theology behind this
trope, through the way the ritual texts framed the interpretation of
Scripture within the Church's exegetical traditions.
Certain passage of Scripture treating Christ's birth, his Messianic identity,
and the theology of incarnation became classic Christmas *loci theologici*
through the mutually reinforcing practices of, first, reading and singing these
passages in the developing Christmas liturgy, and, second, interpreting these
passages in preaching and commentaries.
[On patristic exegesis and its influence, see @Kannengiesser:PatristicExegesis;
@McKim:BiblicalInterpreters; @Thompson:ReadingwDead.]
For example, the tradition of beginning the series of psalms in the Christmas
Matins liturgy with Psalm 2 was influenced by the interpretation of that psalm
as a Messianic prophecy in patristic exegesis---such as the sermons of Pope St.
Leo the Great, Pope St. Gregory the Great, and St. Ambrose, which were included
in Matins as the lessons of the second and third Nocturnes.
Moreover, the Scripture's placement in this liturgical context in turn
reinforced the Messianic interpretation.

#### Theology of Incarnation 

The foundation of the Christmas feast was devotion to "Jesus Christ, \[God's\]
only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin
Mary," as stated in the Apostle's Creed, which in turn was the basis for
catechesis.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 34: "Et in Iesum Christum Filium eius vnicum,
Dominum nostrum"; 
@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 46, "Qui conceptus est de Spiritu sancto, natus ex
Maria virgine."]
The Roman Catechism explains this article by answering a classic theological
question that appeared in many other commentaries, *Cur Deus incarnatus fuerit*
(Why God became incarnate).
The catechism instructs pastors to teach the "admirable mystery of the concept"
by having "the faithful repeat by memory \[...\] that he \[Christ\] is God, who took
on human flesh, and thereby was truly 'made man'---which cannot be grasped by
our mind, nor explained through words: that he should wish to become a human,
to the end that we humans should be reborn as children of God."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 50: "Hæc sunt quæ de admirabili conceptionis
mysterio explicanda visa sunt, ex quibus, vt salutaris fructus ad nos redundare
possit, illa in primis fideles memoria repetere, ac sæpiùs cogitare cum animis
suis debent, Deum esse, qui humanam carnem assumpsit: ea verò ratione hominem
factum, quam mente nobis assequi non licet, ne dum verbis explicare: ob eum
denique finem hominem fieri voluisse, vt nos homines filij Dei renasceremur.
Hæc cùm attentè considerauerint, tum verò omnia mysteria, quæ hoc articulo
continentur, humili ac fideli animo credant, & adorent: nec curiosè & quod sine
periculo vix vnquam fieri potest, illa inuestigare, ac perscrutari velint."]

To answer the same question, Lapide draws on Biblical and patristic sources to
show that Christ's birth is integral to the Christian gospel of salvation
through Christ's sacrifical death and resurrection.
In the birth of Christ, he writes "the Word was made flesh, God was made man,
the Son of God was made the son of a Virgin":

> This was of all God's works the greatest and best, such that it stupefied and
> stupefies the angels and all the saints.
> In this God demonstrated his full power by uniting man to God, the mire to the
> Word, the earth to heaven; and showed his full wisdom, since the one who could
> not suffer and redeem us in his divinity, put on flesh in the Virgin, since in
> flesh he could suffer and make satisfaction for our sins to God the Father;
> and his full justice, so that by the dignity of his person, as one equal to
> God, he satisfied God's wrath and vengeance by dying on the cross; and all his
> goodness, which he poured out completely in order to give away his gifts to
> us; "For he was made the son of men, so that he might make us sons of God,"
> says St. Augustine. "He was born on the earth, so that man might be reborn
> into heaven," as St. Gregory says.
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 50, on Mt. 1:16:
"q. d. Verbum caro factum est, Deus factus est homo, Filius Dei factus est
Filius Virginis.
Hoc, \[...\] fuit omnium Dei operum summum et maximum, ideoque illud stupuerunt et
stupent Angeli, Sanctique omnes.
In eo enim Deus ostendit summam potentiam uniendo hominem Deo, limum Verbo,
terram cœlo: ac summam sapientiam, ut qui divinitate pati et nos redimere non
poterat, carnem in Virgine indueret, qua pati, et pro peccatis nostris Deo Patri
satisfacere posset: summam quoque justititiam, quia ob dignitatem personæ, ex
æquo quasi Dei iræ et vindictæ moriendo in cruce satisfecit: summam etiam
bonitatem, quia semetipsum exinanivit, ut nos suis donis repleret: *Ac factus
est filius hominis, ut nos efficeret filios Dei*, ait S. August. *Natus est in
terra, ut homo nasceretur in cœlo*, ut ait S. Gregorius."]

This is the basic theology of exchange between God and Man by means of Christ's
Incarnation that was celebrated, and enacted, in the Christmas liturgy.
Padilla's villancico text puts this in musical terms, speaking of Christ as
"forming the consonances of Man and God" and concluding that "Everything in God
is to descend, and everything in Man is to ascend."

#### "As Much to Be Heard as to Be Admired"

These formulations not only explain God's action in becoming Incarnate for human
salvation, but also model how the faithful should respond---worshiping and
serving Christ with wonder and admiration, like the shepherds of Bethlehem.
While the Incarnation was certainly a dogma, a "rule of belief," even the
offical catechism moves beyond simply defining a theological concept, to include
an affective, devotional emphasis---a "rule of prayer" as well.[^lex-orandi]
The proper response to meditating on this "all of these mysteries," the
catechism says, would be "that with a humble and faithful spirit they should
believe, and adore."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 50: "Hæc cùm attentè considerauerint, tum verò omnia
mysteria, quæ hoc articulo continentur, humili ac fideli animo credant, &
adorent: nec curiosè & quod sine periculo vix vnquam fieri potest, illa

The idea of a "rule of prayer" comes from a Latin motto, drawn from Prosper of
Aquitaine, that has become a standby in modern liturgical studies, *lex orandi,
lex credendi*.
Rather than use the motto to create a dichotomy between belief and prayer---in
which "the rule of prayer establishes the rule of faith" (see
@Kavanagh:LiturgicalTheology)---the intent here is simply to emphasize that both
faith and worship may be seen as integral and interrelated parts of religious
life in Christianity.
For critical discussion of the motto, with attentions to its actual origin and
its changing meaning in recent scholarship, see @Irwin:LexOrandi.


Wonder at Christ's birth is one of the primary tropes of Christmas, and
much Spanish devotional music seems designed primarily to cultivate this
attitude.
Padilla's setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* evokes wonder not only in the
words in the virtuoso composition and performance of the music as well.
The villancico aims less to instruct than to amaze, just as Mary Gaylord
has said that the goal of elaborate Spanish poetry is "to produce effects of
astonishment and awe conveyed by the Latin term *admiratio*."
Indeed, Padilla's piece asks listeners to imagine a song that is "as much to
hear as to admire \[*admirar*\],/ as much to admire as to hear."
[@Gaylord:Poetry, 227]

In this case the term *admirar* has a more specific association, with the
liturgy of Matins.
Based on the piece's position in the musical manuscripts, it was most likely
sung as the fourth villancico in the Matins cycle on Christmas Eve 1657 at
Puebla Cathedral.
Padilla's *Voces*, according to a 1633 decree of the cathedral chapter, would
have occupied the same liturgical time and space as the fourth Responsory, *O
magnum mysterium et admirabile sacramentum*:

> *Respond.* O great mystery and admirable sacrament, that the animals should
> see the newborn Lord, lying in the manger.
> Blessed Virgin, whose womb was worthy to bear the Lord Christ.\
> *Versicle.* Greetings, Mary, full of grace: The Lord is with you.
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, 175:
"*Respond.* O magnum mysterium, & admirabile sacramentum, vt animalia vidêrent
Dominum natum, iacentem in praesepio: \* Beata Virgo, cuius viscera meruêrunt
portare Dominum Christum. *Versicle.* Ave Maria, gratia plena: Dominus tecum."]

<!-- XXX move up? -->
The chapter mandated that while "the lessons should be sung in their entirety,"
"the *chanzoneta* shall serve for the Responsory, which shall be prayed speaking
while the singing is going on."[^Puebla-Matins-AC]
This villancico stood in between the lessons of the second Nocturne, which were
taken from a Christmas sermon of Pope St. Leo the Great.
This means that after a cantor chanted the first lesson, a cleric spoke the
mandatory liturgical text of the fourth Responsory above *while* the chorus sang
this villancico.
<!-- cantor? -->
Lay people outside the walls of the architectural choir would not probably have
heard or understood the words of the Latin liturgical text, so they would
perhaps not have missed much.
The poet and composer were evidently steeped in the theological and liturgical
traditions of the Church, though, and had good reason to refer to the Responsory
even in situations like this where it was not sung.
For the learned cathedral canons, rather than diminishing the importance of the
Responsory, the simultaneous performance of the Latin prayer and Spanish song
may have actually deepend the hidden connections between the two.

[^Puebla-Matins-AC]:
MEX-Pc: AC 1633-12-30:
"que a los maitines de nauidad deste año y de los venideros \[...\] se canten
todas las liçiones yn totum sin dejar cossa alguna dellas y que la chansoneta
sirba de Responsorio el qual se diga resado mientrass se estubiere cantando."
^[XXX  full text in diss or appendix ]

The Responsory evokes the scenario of the Nativity, with the animals gathered
around the manger, just as the villancico calls up the image of angels, beasts,
and humans joining together in song around the Christ-child.
In the quatrain (a *redondilla*) that closes the estribillo, the lines *tan de
oír y de admirar/ tan de admirar y de oír* actually seem like a reply to the
Responsory, as though to say that the mystery of the Incarnate Christ certainly
was an "admirable" sacrament---that is, one that can be seen---but it is also an
audible sacrament.

Listeners in Puebla could not visit the manger in Bethlehem; they could only look
at the retable paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Visitation of
the Kings and imagine.
^[XXX  chrysostom quote ]
But in the conception of this villancico, they could hear the "voices of the
chapel choir" reverberating in the space and through those voices they could
"hear the voice of the Father/ singing in tones of weeping"---that is, they
could hear the Christ the Word himself not merely speaking, but singing, through
all the other voices from the choirboys up to the angels.

Wonder at the sight and sound of the newborn Christ-child was a central theme in
contemporary and patristic Christmas preaching.
In a model sermon for Christmas (originally written in Portuguese for the Lisbon
court but widely circulated in a Spanish translation), Fray Luis de Granada
alludes to the same responsory in a similar way: "Oh venerable misterio, mas
para sentir que para decir."
^[XXX  full text elsewhere or original text here with page ]
This reference comes after he exhorts worshippers to marvel at the lowliness of
Christ's birth:

> Come and see the Son of God, not in the bosom of the Father \[Jn 1\], but in
> the arms of the Mother; not above choirs of angels, but among filthy animals;
> not seated at the right hand of the Majesty on high \[Heb 1\], but
> reclining in a stable for beasts; not thundering and casting lightning in
> Heaven, but crying and trembling from cold in a stable.
> What theme, then, can cause any greater wonder?
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 5]

Paraphrasing St. Cyprian, he goes on: 

> I do not wonder at the figure of the world, nor the firmness of the earth
> \[...\]; I marvel to see how the word of God could take on flesh. \[...\] 
> In this mystery the greatness of the shock steals away all my senses, and with
> the prophet \[Hab. 3\] it makes me cry out: Lord, I heard your words, and I
> feared: I considered your works, and I was struck numb.
> With good reason, indeed, you are amazed, Prophet: for what thing could
> surprise anyone more, than that to which the Evangelist here refers in a few
> words, saying, "She gave birth to her only-begotten son, and she wrapped him
> in some rags, and laid him in a manger, because she did not find another place
> in that stable?

> O venerable mystery, more to be felt than to be spoken of; not to be explained
> with words but to be adored with wonder in silence. 
> What could be lower than a manger, which is a place for beasts, and what could
> be higher than God, who is seated among the cherubim?
> Indeed, how can a man not be long in ecstasy in meditating on two things that
> are so distant: God in a stable, God in a manger, God trembling from cold, God
> wrapped in rags, God crying?
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 11--12]

Fray Luis is not only preaching about wonder; his preaching itself becomes an
act of devotion in contemplating the Incarnation as the union of opposites.
Just as Padilla's second copla says that God "made a composition from on high
\[*alto*\], and of the maxima and breve," Fray Luis says, "Who is this so high
and so low, so great and so small? \[...\] What high-and-low things \[*qué
altibajos*\] are these that the wisdom of God joined together as one?" 
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 24]
The response he models to this "mystery" is to be "struck numb," to "worship
with wonder \[*admiración*\] in silence."
In a similar passage, Lapide goes even further to speak of being "stupefied" and
"struck deaf" \[*attonitus*\] at the sight of Christ in the manger.
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 672, on Lk 2:7:
"Christus enim in præsepio, hoc est Jesu homo, Verbum infans, est amor, æque ac
stupor omnium angelorium ac fidelium, quod omnes stupent et stupebunt per omnem
æternitatem.
Quis enim non attonitus stupeat, si profunde hunc puerum inspiciat, eumque
rogat, Quis es tu, ô parvule Bethlehemitice? eumque audiat respondentem: Disce
id ex Isaia cap. 9. 6. *Parvulus natus est nobis, et filius datus est nobis*,
etc."]

#### Listening to the Christ-Child's Voice

In addition to picturing the stable visually, Fray Luis exhorts worshippers to
turn from sight toward hearing:

> After the devout sight of the manger we open our ears to hear the music of the
> angels, of whom the Evangelist says, that when one of them had finished giving
> these very glad tidings to the shepherds, there were joined with him a crowd
> of the heavenly army, and that they all in one voice sang upon the airs
> praises to God, saying, Glory be to God in the heights, and on the earth peace
> to men of good will.
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 24]

More important than these angelic voices to Fray Luis, however, is the voice of
the newborn Christ himself, "weeping and trembling with cold in the stable."
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 9]
Fray Luis follows the exegetical tradition of reading Wisdom 7 as a Messianic
prophecy, such that King Solomon's words about himself may be applied to his
royal descendent, Christ: "I too am a mortal man like others, \[...\] and the
first sound [*voz*] that I made was crying like other children, because not one
of the kings had any different origin in their birth."
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 9; cf. @Lapide:Gospels19C, 670, on Lk. 2:7]

Fray Luis, as an avid student and teacher of Catholic Humanism, presents Christ
as an orator and philosophical teacher, a "Master of Heaven"---*Maestro del
cielo*, the same term used for a musical master.
He explicitly compares the voice of this incarnate Word with music:

> Oh fortunate house!
> Oh stable, more precious than all the royal palaces, where God sat upon the
> chair \[*cátedra*\] of the philosophy of heaven, where the word of God, though
> made mute, speaks so much more clearly, all the more silently it admonishes
> us!
> Look, then, brother, if you wish to be a true philosopher, do not remove
> yourself from this stable where the word of God cries while keeping silent;
> but this cry is greater eloquence than that of Tully [Cicero], and even than
> the music of the angels of heaven.
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 16:
\[XXX first portion\]
"donde la palabra de Dios enmudecida, tanto mas claramente hable, cuanto mas
calladamente nos avisa.
Mira, pues, hermano, si quieres ser verdadero filósofo no te apartes deste
establo donde la palabra de Dios callando llora; mas este lloro es mayor
elocuencia que la de Tulio, y aun que las músicas de los ángeles del cielo."]

For this passage Fray Luis cites "a doctor," and in fact the whole passage is a
paraphrase from St. Bernard of Clairvaux.
The Latin key term behind the friar's phrase *la palabra de Dios enmudecida* is,
in Bernard's fifth Christmas sermon, *Verbum infans*---the Word who is both
"infant" and "unspeaking," since like the Spanish *infante* in Padilla's
villancico, the Latin word *infans* can have either meaning.
Bernard expresses the trope in this way:

> But what kind of mediator is this, you ask, who is born in a stable, placed in
> a manger, wrapped in cloths like all others, cries like all others, in sum,
> who lies unspeaking as an infant \[*infans*\], just as others are accustomed to
> do?
> A great mediator he is indeed, even in this seeking all the things that are
> for peace, not just going through the motions but working effectively.
> He is an infant, but he is the infant Word \[*Verbum infans*\], and not even in
> his infancy does he keep silent.
[@Bernard:Nativitate, 128A, Sermo V:
"Sed qualis mediator est, inquies, qui in stabulo nascitur, in praesepio
ponitur, pannis involvitur sicut caeteri, plorat ut caeteri, denique infans
jacet, ut caeteri consueverunt?
Magnus plane mediator est, etiam in his omnibus, quae ad pacem sunt, non
perfunctorie, sed efficaciter quaerens.
Infans quidem est, sed Verbum infans, cujus ne ipsa quidem infantia tacet."]

Bernard is himself drawing on an older tradition of the theology of the Word
going back to St. Augustine, who reiterates this trope throughout his dozens of
Christmas sermons.
Augustine's editors even title one sermon *Verbum infans doctor humilitatis*---the
infant Word, teacher of humility.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1004, heading for sermon 187.]
^[XXX  him or his editor? which editor? ]
In another, Augustine preaches,

> \[This day\] is called the Nativity of the Lord, when the Wisdom of God
> manifested itself unspeaking \[or, as an infant\], and the Word of God without
> words sent forth a voice of flesh.
> That divinity which was thus hidden, was both signified to the Magi by the
> witness of Heaven, and announced to the shepherds by an angelic voice.
> This, therefore, is the day whose anniversary we celebrate in our ritual.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 997, Sermo 185, In Natali Domini 2:
"Natalis Domini dicitur, quando Dei Sapientia se demonstravit infantem, et Dei
Verbum sine verbis vocem carnis emisit.
Illa tamen occulta divinitas, et Magis coelo teste significate, et pastoribus
angelica voce nuntiata est.
Hanc igitur anniversaria solemnitate celebramus diem \[...\]."]

In true Neoplatonic fashion, Augustine builds a chain of signification from the
highest level of being---the Godhead and its incarnation as the
Christ-child---to the signs that pointed to this reality in the material world;
moving from divine Wisdom to the child in whom God manifested himself.
He then moves to the worldly signs that pointed to Christ at his birth, and then
links this to the present-day ritual of the Mass of the Nativity.
As the master of a theology of communication through sign and signified (in *De
doctrina christiana*), Augustine is teaching the faithful to hear the words
proclaimed in their midst (Scripture, preaching, liturgy) as signs pointing
first to the angels' song in Bethlehem, and to hear and heed the angel's
exhortation to the shepherds to seek out the "sign" of "a child wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in a manger" (Luke 2:XXX).
The Christ child they found was at this "infant" stage of life, not a speaker of
divine words, but was the very Word himself---as Augustine says, "a voice of
flesh."

Augustine uses the voice as an extended metaphor for understanding the actual
process of Christ's Incarnation.
^[XXX  which is why music can then be added on ]
Augustine uses the peculiar features of the voice to defend the doctrine that
Christ was not "changed" into flesh, but "remained the Son of God" even "having
been made the Son of Man."
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1002, Sermo 187, In Natali Domini 4:
"manentem Dei filium, factum hominis filium."]
^[XXX  rest of quote ]
The Word of God existed from eternity, Augustine teaches, drawing on his
learning in rhetoric and language (as also expressed in his treatise *De
musica*).
In its eternal state it "was not varied by punctuation marks whether short or
long \[*nec morulis brevibus longisque*, a concept echoed in Padilla's *máxima y
breve*\], nor drawn together by the voice, nor ended by silence."
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1001, Sermo 187, In Natali Domini 4:
"Quanto magis Verbum Dei, per quod facta sunt omnia, et quod in se manens
innovat omnia; quod nec locis concluditur; nec temporibus tenditur, nec morulis
brevibus longisque variatur, nec vocibus texitur, nec silentio terminatur;
quanto magis hoc tantum et tale Verbum potuit matris uterum assumpto corpore
fecundare, et de sinu Patris non emigrare?"]
But Christ as the Word took on flesh and became known to humans, Augustine
teaches, just an idea becomes a spoken word, without ceasing to be an idea.
In the form of a spoken word it can be communicated to those who hear it and
enter into their minds as an idea.
This is because for Augustine, a word first exists as pure thought before it is
spoken, but when uttered is "clothed in the voice":

> A word \[*verbum*; or, thought\] that we carry in the heart, when joined with a
> voice \[*vox*; or, speech, spoken word\], we bring forth to the ear, is not
> changed into the voice, but the whole word is assumed into the voice in which
> it proceeds, so that internally the idea the word makes intelligible remains,
> while externally the voice produces the sound that is heard.
> This word, then, brings forth in sound, what previously resounded in silence.
> The word, upon being made a voice \[or, upon being spoken\], is not changed into
> the voice itself, but rather, remaining in the mind's light, and having
> assumed the voice \[or speech\] of flesh, it proceeds to the hearer, and does
> not leave the thinker.
> The word in silence is not thought by means of this voice \[spoken word\],
> whether it is Greek or Latin or whatever other tongue: but rather, the thing
> itself which is to be said, before all other differentiations of tongues, is
> understood in some naked manner in the chambers of the heart, from whence it
> proceeds, being spoken, to be clothed in the voice.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1002, Sermo 187, In Natali Domini 4:
"Sicut verbum quod corde gestamus, fit vox cum id ore proferimus, non tamen
illud in hanc commutatur, sed illo integro ista in qua procedat assumitur, ut et
intus maneat quod intelligatur, et foris sonet quod adiatur: hoc idem tamen
profertur in sono, quod ante sonuerat in silentio; atque ita verbum cum fit vox,
non mutatur in vocem; sed manens in mentis luce, et assumpta carnis voce
procedit ad audientem, et non deserti cogitantem.
Non cum ipsa vox in silentio cogitatur, quae vel graecae est, vel latinae, vel
linguae alterius cujuslibet: sed cum ante omnem linguarum diversitatem res ipsa
quae dicenda est, adhuc in cubili cordis quodam modo nuda est intelligenti, quae
ut inde procedat loquentis voce vestitur." XXX cf passage in De doctrina
Christiana I]

Augustine is reflecting on language as a way to understand how Christ can be in
his body the form of communication between God and
humankind.[^Augustine-further-word]
Human thought is transferred from one person's inner heart and mind to that of
another by means of the external medium of the spoken voice.
The body thus converts an inarticulate, abstract idea into a form that others
can perceive through the physical act of hearing.
The voice itself, then, is independent of the body; it transfers the idea
to the hearer without the idea leaving the speaker's mind.
Theologically, in Augustine's conception, Christ as the eternal Word is like
the inner thought before being expressed in speech; Christ as the Word made
flesh is like the human spoken word.
Thus the Christ-child embodies divine communication not through spoken words,
but through his very body.

[^Augustine-further-word]:
For further on Augustine's concept of the Word and its relationship to language
and rhetoric, see the sermons *De verbis Domini* and the treatise *De doctrina
christiana*.
The theology of Christ as the Word is also exhaustively treated in Lapide's
commentary on the first chapter of John, @Lapide:Gospels19C, 872--889.

It is probably no accident that the phrase *lo que se canta* in the opening
sentence of the poem corresponds literally to a phrase used by Augustine in the
famous passage about listening to music in the *Confessions*.
Augustine confesses that he sins when "it happens to me that the song moves me
more than what is is sung."
[@Augustine:ConfessionesPL, 10:33 XXX:
"Tamen, cum mihi accidit ut me amplius cantus, quam res quae canitur, moveat;
poenaliter me peccare confiteor, et tunc mallem non audire cantantem."]
Though it is plausible to translate the passage as referring to "the song,
rather than the words that are sung" (as in Strunk XXX), Augustine twice in this
passage uses the same words contrasting *cantus* (song) with *res quae canitur*,
literally "the thing that is sung."
This choice of words connects to Augustine's theology of signs in *De doctrina
christiana*, in which everything in the world is either a *res* (thing, object)
or a *signum* (sign) that points to a *res*.
The "song," then, would be the sign that points to "what is sung"---a concept
that need not be limited to the words of the song, but should be understood
within the context of Augustine's Christian Neoplatonism, referring to a
higher reality as the object of the song. 
Augustine is confessing that he failed to rise in contemplation from the created
world to its Creator, that is, because of his sensual appetites he failed to
discern the sensory world (the song that he hears) as a sign pointing to the
ultimate *res* or being to which all lesser things owe their existence, the Holy
Trinity.
In the villancico, "what is sung" refers first to the present-day singing of the
chapel choir, but that itself is a sign pointing to the voices of the first
Christmas and ultimately to Christ who is himself both sign and signified.

The concept of the *Verbum infans*, then, is that Christ as an infant cannot
speak words, but this is fitting since he himself is the Word.
This all amounts to an extended exegesis of the opening of the New Testament
letter to the Hebrews, which contrasts God's communications to humanity
through prophetic words with his final communication in the person of Jesus:
"Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets,
but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son \[...\]. He is the reflection
of God's glory and the exact imprint of God's very being, and he sustains all
things by his powerful word" (Heb. 1:1--3, NRSV).
Lapide connects Word and Incarnation thus: "We hear God teaching and preaching
from the chair \[*cathedra*\] of this manger, not by a word but by a deed: \[...\]
I have been made a little one, of your bone and your flesh, I am made man, in
order to make you God."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 673, on Lk. 2:
"Quid fecit tantus Deus, in tantilla carne, jacens in præsepio?
Audiamus ipsummet in præsepii cathedra, non verbo sed facto docentem et
prædicantem: \[...\] 
Parvulus factus sum, os tuum et caro tua, factus sum homo, ut te Deum
efficerem."]
Lapide paraphrases St. Cyril on the Word in John's Gospel 1:3 ("through him \[the
Word\] all things were made"):

> An artisan \[*artifex*\] makes all of the works of his craft \[*opera artis*\]
> according to the idea, knowledge \[wisdom\], concept, or "word" \[thought\]
> that is in his mind: all of these comparisons are appropriate for the divine
> Word, or Son, who is Wisdom begotten, not made; and by consequence it is also
> appropriate to say that by him all things were made."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 877, on Jn. 1:3:
"Artifex enim omnia opera artis suæ facit per ideam, sapientiam, conceptum, sive
verbum mentis suæ: hæc autem omnia appropriantur Verbo divino, sive Filio, qui
est Sapientia genita, sed increata; et per consequens appropriatur ei, quod per
ipsum omnia sint facta. Ita S. Cyrillus."]

#### Christ the Word as Both Song and Singer

As the villancico *Voces, las de la capilla* presents these tropes, the
Christ-child is the masterwork that proves the craft of the divine
*artifex*---now a chapelmaster in the Spanish fashion.
Bringing together *maxima* and *breve*, "high" and low in the incarnate Christ,
God the Father "proves" that he can form "consonances between a man and God"
(copla 2).
Thus on one level Christ is God's song, and "the Word" is envisioned not as
speech but as music.
Christ, then, takes the "lyrics" of his ancestor David, royal chapelmaster, and
"sets them to notes" (poem l. 7) through his heroic, sacrificial life.
He himself holds the *clave* (musical clef/key of authority); he himself is the
*divisa* (sign); and it is Christ himself who is *el signo a la mi re*, "the
sign of A"---the first note of a new song in which can be heard "the voice of
the Father." (ll. 9, 11, 24, 27).
This connects to a larger theological trope of the "new song," based on
Revelations XXX:XXX, numerous psalms, and other Scriptures.
^[XXX  examples of new song trope ]

The poem's "sign of *A (la, mi, re)*"---realized by Padilla through puns of
solmization on these syllables---connects the concept of Christ as the song to
that of Christ as the singer as well.
This theological tradition sees Christ the Word as a "sign," and therefore even
as a "letter."
Covarrubias glosses Spanish *divisa* with the Latin *signum*, from the Greek
*sēma*, sign; and Lapide calls Christ "the sign of reconciliation of the human
race to God."
[@Covarrubias:Tesoro, s.v. *divisa*; @Lapide:Gospels19C, 685--686, on Lk. 2]
Augustine connects the concept of the Word in Jn. 1 to Christ's statement in the
Revelation to John, "I am *alpha* and *omega*, first and last, beginning and
end" (Rev. 22:13).
"And just as no letter comes before *alpha*," Augustine preaches, nothing
precedes Christ or follows after him, "for he is God."
In the villancico's terms, "the one who is before time" (l. 24).
[@Augustine:Opera1555, vol. 10, 118r, In Natali Domini 2:
"Si fides assit, aperta est ratio qua Christus nunc minor, nunc aequalis patri
sacris voluminibus asseratur, sicut ipse de se dicit, Ego primus & novissimus.
Indubitanter agnosce quòd priorem non potest habere qui primus est.
Item, Ego sum α et ω. Et sicut alpha litera nulla praecedit, ita & filium dei
nulli secundum constat esse, quia deus est."
See also @Lapide:Apocalypse1627, on Rev. 1.]

Augustine uses the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet to explain the
doctrine of the two conceptions of Christ, namely, that the Son of God was
begotten eternally of the Father, but born temporally of the Virgin.
^[XXX  catechism on this ]
Christ's status as the Word had no beginning, but there was a temporal beginning
to his life as a man.
Thus in the villancico the *divisa* signifies the start of a new *tiempo* (l.
11, 23).
To use Augustine's concept of voice and word discussed earlier, then, the
beginning of Christ's human life is the moment when idea becomes voice and
communication becomes possible.

What theological significance, in this tradition of theology, would be
attributed to the actual voice of the baby Jesus?
Bernard says the *Verbum infans* is "silent," and Fray Luis describes Christ as
an orator but makes clear that Christ himself *is* the oration.
Augustine's treatment of the voice is really a metaphor for Incarnation, not an
attempt to speak of Christ's literal voice.
But the concept of "the sign of A" in the villancico opens up the possibility of
interpreting the newborn Christ's inarticulate cries as an expression, not of
verbal concepts, but of his physical being.
Covarrubias begins his Spanish dictionary with this definition of the letter A
(pronounced like *ah* in Spanish):

> The first letter in order according to all the nations that used characters,
> \[...\] and this because of its being so very simple in its pronunciation
> \[*prolación*\]. \[...\] And thus it is the first thing that man pronounces in
> being born, except that the male (since he has more strength) says A, and the
> female E \[pronounced *eh*\], in which man seems to enter into the wrld,
> lamenting his first parents Adam and Eve.
[@Covarrubias:Tesoro, s.v. *A*:
"Primera letra en orden cerca de todas las naciones que usaron caracteres, \[...\]
y esto por ser simplicissima en su prolacion. \[...\]
Y assi es la primera que el hombre pronuncia en naciendo, saluo que el varon
como tiene mas fuerça dize A, y la hembra E, en que parece entrar en el mundo,
lamentandose de sus primeros padres Adan y Eva."
On symbolic alphabets in early modern devotional music, see @Kendrick:Jeremiah,
XXX.]

By this account, keeping in mind Fray Luis's description of Christ's newborn
cries, the baby Jesus first cried out with the inarticulate vowel *A*,
expressing in this sound his essenced as *alpha* and *omega*, as incarnate Word.
Of course, A is also the first of the musical tones alphabetically, and may have
been used as a common tuning pitch, as today.
^[XXX  evidence ]
The sound of his voice in this context expressed Christ's identity as the son of
Adam, while also serving as a tuning note, or intonation, for a new song to
replace the "wandering song" given to "the first man" (l. 34--35).
All the other voices of Christmas follow after and echo the voice of Christ.
Thus Christ in his cries performs the song that he himself is.
What the worshippers heard in the baby's cries was "the voice of the Father/
singing in tones of weeping," a "song/ as much to hear as to admire" (ll.
27--30).
This was not just an *admirabile sacramentum* as in the Responsory, but an
audible sacrament as well---the sign of the bodily presence of the divine
entering into their ears through sounds that were more like music than speech.

Musical performance provided an apt medium to realize this concept, as the
singing and playing gave material form to the concepts of the poetry and
illustrated those concepts through the artifice of the music.
Augustine, Fray Luis, and Lapide all connect the present-day liturgy of
Christmas to the historical music of the angels at Christmas and ultimately to
Christ himself as the divine Word, *Verbum infans*.
Likewise, the villancico poem begins by invoking not angelic choirs or the
musical menagerie of the manger, but rather calls listeners' attention to the
"voices of the chapel choir," asking them to heed "what is sung" (ll. 1--2).
Only through "putting notes to his lyrics" can the composer fully enact the
concept of theological hearing central to the text.
Listeners are asked to pay attention not only to the words, but to "what is
sung"---which includes the sonic whole of the composition with its plays of
solmization, rhythm, stylistic allusion, and contrapuntal devices.
Through the voices of the Puebla chapel choir, the faithful could listen for the
unhearable higher music of Christmas, which ultimately meant encountering Christ
himself.

### Establishing a Pedigree in a Lineage of Metamusical Composition

The high level of ingenuity, both theological and musical, in this villancico
makes *Voces, las de la capilla* one of Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla's
master-works, in the early modern sense of a piece that proves the artisan's
mastery of his craft.
As such, the piece served a social function in addition to being an object of
devotion.
For Padilla's fellow musicians, chapelmasters, and the educated elite of Puebla,
the piece demonstrated Padilla's skill and established his place in a tradition
of composition.
Padilla's setting is one link in a chain of homage and emulation, within a
specific family of villancicos as well as within the broader subgenre of
metamusical pieces studied in this part.
Evidence survives for two previous villancicos based on the same or similar
poems, though the music for both is apparently lost.
These pieces allowed Spanish composers to prove both their compositional craft
and their acuity as literary and theological interpreters in a tradition of
"music about music."

The two earlier versions related to Padilla's 1657 piece are these (see table
`ref:table:Voces-Cantores-settings`):

1. *Voces, las de la capilla*, two prior sources:
    - Text only in poetry imprint from a performance by the Portuguese Royal
      Chapel in Lisbon, Christmas 1642[^Lisbon-1642-pliego]
    - Entry for a musical setting of a Christmas villancico with the same
      incipits by Fray Francisco de Santiago (d. 1644) in the 1649 catalog of
      King João IV of Portugal (text incipits only)
      [@JohnIV:Catalog, caixão 26, no. 674; see also @Ribeiro:JohnIV.]
2. *Cantores de la capilla*, performed for Epiphany at the cathedral of Seville,
   January 6, 1647, probably set to music by Seville's chapelmaster Luis
   Bernardo Jalón.
    - Text only in poetry imprint from Seville 1647; single exemplar is

Santiago, a Carmelite friar, was born with the surname Veiga in Portugal and
served as chapelmaster at Seville from 1617 (succeeding Alonso Lobo) to 1643
(succeeded by Luis Bernardo Jalón).
[@Stevenson:SantiagoF; @Perez:DMEH-Santiago]
<!-- XXX DMEH sv Sevilla? -->
Santiago had maintained a lifelong association and correspondence with the Duke
of Braganza, who after 1640 reigned as King João IV of Portugal.
Santiago obtained permission from the Seville Cathedral chapter to visit Lisbon
every five years (1625, 1630, 1635, and 1640).
Whether Santiago wrote specifically for the royal chapel in Lisbon, or
simply brought John IV copies of his music from Seville, the Portuguese monarch
acquired a collection of five hundred thirty-eight villancicos by Santiago, not
to mention other musical genres.
Among the "Christmas Villancicos of Fray Francisco de Santiago" in the catalog
John had compiled and printed in 1649 appears the following entry:
"Vozes las de la capilla. solo. Ya trechos las distancias. a 9." 
[@JohnIV:Catalog, caixão 26, no. 674]
Unfortunately only this description remains; the music parts probably perished
along with the rest of the collection in the fires that followed the Lisbon
earthquake of 1755.

<!-- evidence that Lisbon pliego pieces are same as those in catalog (not strong
case); Anton Llorente also links to Puebla, check voicing and text  -->

It is not known yet whether the 1642 Lisbon imprint presents the text of the
same villancico by Francisco de Santiago recorded in the 1649 catalog.
The imprint, as was typical, does not list the composer or poet's names.
In support of the argument that the imprint corresponds to Santiago's setting is
the evidence that in 1640, the year Santiago last visited Lisbon, an imprint
records the performance by João IV's chapel of another villancico, *Anton
Llorente y Bartolo* which would also later be included in the 1649 catalog among
the works of Santiago.
^[XXX Anton Llorente pliego & catalog]
On the other hand, Santiago was probably in Seville in 1642, beginning to suffer
the paralyzing illness which would soon end his life.  
In 1643 the chapter hired Luis Bernardo Jalón to substitute for Santiago that
Christmas, and Santiago died in October 1644.
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB]
^[XXX confirm that Santiago was in Seville in 1642]

<!-- analyze 1642 pliego text -->

Jalón, as chapelmaster of Seville Cathedral, was probably the composer for the
next known villancico in this family, the poem *Cantores de la capilla*,
performed there for Epiphany 1647 (poem example `ref:poem:Cantores-Jalon`).
Jalón's position at Seville was the culmination of a restlessly ambitious
career.
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB]
He had left his post at the Convento de la Encarnación in 1623 to be
chapelmaster of the cathedrals of Burgos (1623--1634), Cuenca (1634--1642), and
Toledo (1642--1643).
On November 10, 1643, he was appointed chapelmaster at the cathedral of Santiago
de Compostela, but dropped everything a month later when he was invited to
assist the ailing Santiago at Seville Cathedral for the Christmas season of
1634--44.
It is easy to imagine that the two composers had close contact during that time,
and in any case, Jalón could have had access to Santiago's music in the
cathedral archive.
Jalón's setting of *Cantores* was performed only two years after Santiago's
death (considering Epiphany 1647 as part of the 1646--47 liturgical season), and
it is plausible that Jalón composed the piece deliberately in homage to his
predecessor.

(insert poem example `ref:poem:Cantores-Jalon`)
`label:poem:Cantores-Jalon`

<!-- table comparing all 3 versions -->
<!-- rewrite comparing with 1642 version -->

The text corresponds closely to the text of Padilla's *Voces, las de la
capilla*.
The first four lines of both poems are the same, except that Jalón's text has
*Cantores* (singers) instead of *Voces* (voices) and *Niño* (child) instead of
*Rey* (king).
Most of the last half of the estribillo in the Jalón print is the same as that
set by Padilla, including the identical closing couplet.
Jalón's fourth copla is identical to the end of Padilla's *introducción*.

But there are important differences as well that suggest different aesthetic
goals.
In terms of theological and musical conceits, *Cantores* reads like an attempt
to take the dense *conceptismo* of *Voces* and both simplify and explain it.
The connection of Christ's voice ("the sign of A") and the "voices of the chapel
choir" is obscured, as the opening is changed to "singers of the chapel choir."
The crucial lines from *Voces*, "a la voz del padre oí/ cantar por puntos de
llanto," are missing as well, which makes it harder to make sense of "el signo a
la mi re."
The thematically central second copla of *Voces* is absent from *Cantores*,
obscuring the conceit of God as a musician and the newborn Christ as his
masterwork.
The connection between David and Christ as musician-kings is absent as well.
"The King is a musician" in *Voces* is changed to "the child is a musician"---so
that Christ is now explicitly the creator of the music rather than himself being
the Music *and* the musician.
Throughout the poems, where *Voces* has an ambiguous or cryptic line, *Cantores*
has a less multivalent one: instead of "a la voz del padre oí" *Cantores* has
"con que mil maravillas vi"; instead of "y aguardan tiempo oportuno/ quien antes
del tiempo fue" *Cantores* has "después que aguardaron uno/ que llegó a tiempo
oportuno/ quién antes del tiempo fue."
The *Voces* version of these lines is pithy but a bit arcane; the *Cantores*
version is crystal-clear but requires an extra line to say the same thing.

The *conceptismo* in *Cantores* is not as tight as in *Voces*: in many cases,
*Cantores* makes sense on the musical side but not on the theological side.
Some of the musical terminology is deployed innaccurately, as when *Cantores*
has Christ the composer writing in "compás mayor" in a "proporción abreviada"
using a "clave con tres tiempos"---it is hard to know which actual meters might
be indicated here.
The poet of *Cantores* writes multiple lines like "O que lindamente suenan!/ o
que dulcemente cantan" that do not advance the conceit, where the poet of
*Voces* restrained such effusions to the four-syllable "O qué canto."
The new poet has retained the technical terms and other key words used in the
first version of the poem, but has attempted to explain the metaphors, sometimes
in ways that change the meaning from the first poem.

In terms of structure and meter, *Voces* is more intricately patterned than
*Cantores*: it features a *respuesta* section and a *linea de vuelta* joining the
last line of the coplas to the beginning of the estribillo.
The *respuesta* was more commonly used in villancicos before 1640, though
Padilla continues to use it in several pieces of the 1650s.
The *linea de vuelta* was a holdover from the rather different structure of the
courtly villancicos of the sixteenth century, such as those set by Juan del
Encina.
[@Navarro:Metrica, XXX]
Both Padilla's *Voces* and the incipit for Santiago's *Voces* contain the *linea
de vuelta*, "Y a trechos las distancias."
*Cantores*, by contrast, has no *respuesta* and omits this line.
The estribillo of Padilla's *Voces* begins with the *linea de vuelta*, followed
by a series of fully rhymed verse pairs, all in eight-syllable lines.
The half-line "uno a uno" forms a bracket with the other half-line "O qué
canto," marking off this section of paired verses from the closing quatrain, a
*redondilla abrazada*.
By contrast, the estribillo of *Cantores* begins with two lines with neither
assonance nor rhyme, followed by a line that rhymes with nothing and can only
scan as eight syllables if *que* and *lleva* are elided; the fourth line can
only be read as ten syllables.
The next four lines group in pairs with full rhymes, alternating lines of six
and eleven syllables.
These metrical irregularities are confined to this first portion of the
estribillo; after this the remainder is almost identical to *Voces*.
Thus the first section appears "tacked on" to the more refined pre-existing
material in the second section.
^[XXX  line numbers; poem in text? ]

Some changes in Jalón's setting bear evidence of adaptation for use in the
liturgy of Matins for Epiphany in Seville.
Where *Voces* alludes to the presence of angels, animals, and shepherds at the
manger, *Cantores* explicitly includes the "three Kings" as well in copla 3.
The slightly greater emphasis on the heavens, and on the concept of time
(musical and theological), might also be intended to connect with the visit of
these mysterious astrologers from the East.
But other aspects of the adaptation actually seem to make it *less* well suited
for Epiphany, in particular the omission of the line "a la voz del padre oí."
According to this piece's placement in the poetry imprint, as the second in a
cycle of nine villancicos, *Cantores* would have been paired with a 
Responsory, drawn from the Gospel narratives of Christ's baptism, with the
Versicle, "The heavens were opened above him, and the voice of the Father
intoned." and the Respond, "This is my beloved Son."
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, XXX:
"*Respond.* In columbæ specie Spiritus sanctus visus est, paterna vox audita
est:
\* Hic est Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi bene complácui.
*Versicle.* Cȩli aperti sunt super eum, & vox Patris intónuit. Hic est Filius."]
This chant would match well with the line about hearing "the voice of the
Father" in Padilla's *Voces*, when the piece was likely repeated with the other
1657 Christmas villancicos for Epiphany in January 1658.
It seems to make little sense that the compositor of this text should add some
explicit Three Kings references but omit this line that fit so well with that
feast's liturgy.
It seems likely, then, that this version of the text was not devised for this
specific liturgical placement, just for the feast of Kings in general, and Jalón
selected the arrangement in the Matins cycle based on fairly loose theological
criteria.
^[XXX  Responsory performance in Sevilla? ]
The piece did not need to be a perfect fit liturgically in order to fulfill the
dual function of paying homage to Santiago while also demonstrating Jalón's own
position representing the new generation, the next step in the tradition at
Seville.


<!-- XXX REWRITE
Although the text of *Cantores* predates that of Padilla's *Voces* by ten years,
Padilla's text may actually preserve an earlier stage of the textual tradition.
A stronger philological argument can be made that Jalón's *Cantores de
la capilla* is actually an adaptation of *Voces, las de la capilla* than for the
reverse situation.
Upon close comparison *Cantores* appears to be a somewhat garbled attempt to
simplify the arcane, Góngora-influenced poetry of *Voces* to make it suit the
tastes of a younger generation that favored greater clarity and conventionality.

(include table  `ref:table:Voces-Cantores-settings`
`label:table:Voces-Cantores-settings`

-->

There are several ways that Padilla might have known Santiago's setting of
*Voces* or the poem on which it was based.
It is quite likely that the two chapelmasters knew each other personally from
Padilla's early career in Andalucía.
Padilla, baptized in Málaga in 1590, climbed his way rapidly up the ladder of
prestigious positions in the region, moving from positions at Ronda (1608--1612)
and Jerez de la Frontera (1612--1616) to the cathedral of Cádiz, where he served
as chapelmaster from March 17, 1616 until he emigrated to New Spain in 1622.
[@Gembero:Padilla]
Padilla's years in Cádiz overlap with Santiago's tenure in Seville (1617--1643),
leaving about six years when the two chapelmasters could easily have interacted
either thorugh correspondence or personally.
The two port cities, about 121 km apart, were closely linked economically and
socially.
Both cities were among the first to print leaflets of villancico poems, and
Padilla could have had access to the texts set by Santiago through this medium
alone.
[@BNE:VCs17C, s.v. *Cádiz* and *Sevilla*]
These imprints circulated widely and enabled provincial churches to stay
up-to-date with the latest trends, especially those of the Royal Chapel in
Madrid and the cathedral of Seville.
There are several substantial collections of villancico imprints from Seville
preserved in Puebla.
<!-- XXX signatures -->
Thus even if there was no personal connection between Padilla and Santiago, the
Seville composer's position at the helm of the flagship music program in the
Hispanic world (in fact, the mother church for all of the Indies), would have
made him a prime target for emulation, homage, or competition.

In fact, Santiago's appointment at Seville may have even precipitated Padilla's
departure for the New World.
Santiago was hired at Seville without any public competition for the position,
which would have been the pinnacle of achievement for any Spanish composer,
particularly one from Andalucía.
Padilla had just started his position in Cádiz---not a lowly post---but the
appointment of  the relatively young Santiago would have deprived him of any
hopes of further advancement on the Spanish main.
Other prominent posts in Madrid were taken, with Mateo Romero at the Royal Chapel
since 1598, and at the presitigious Convento de la Encarnación, none other than
Luis Bernardo Jalón.
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB] <!-- Capilla real? -->
This may have been part of the reason why in about 1622, Padilla sought better
opportunities in America.

<!-- ANton Llorente and circumstantial evidence that Santiago's music was known
in Puebla -->

#### Version by Luis Bernardo Jalón, 1647

#### Demonstrating Musical Kinship

The differences between the texts set by Jalón and Padilla are consistent with
the explanation that *Cantores* is an adaptation of *Voces* to suit less
Gongoresque tastes, and that it is not an especially skillful adaption.
The relationships between the three settings are summarized in table
`ref:table:Voces-connections`.
Since Santiago's villancico from before 1634 has the same incipits as Padilla's
1657 setting, and since Jalón was Santiago's successor at Seville and composed
his *Cantores* setting only two Christmas--Epiphany seasons after Santiago's
death, it seems plausible that both Jalón and Padilla knew Santiago's earlier
version (or at least knew of its text) and deliberately chose to set their
particular versions in order to situate themselves differently in relation to
the earlier master.
Jalón pays homage to Santiago by basing his villancico on the same text,
but also shows his differences from his predecessor by using an "improved"
version of the poem, and, one may imagine, a more modern musical style as well.

(insert table `ref:table:Voces-connections`)
`label:table:Voces-connections`

Padilla almost certainly knew of Jalón's version from the poetry imprint, since
the single extant source of *Cantores* survives in Puebla in a binder's
collection that includes other texts with correspondences to Padilla's
villancicos.[^Puebla-Seville-Binders-collection]
Padilla regularly used texts of peninsular imprints, such as his 1653 *A la
jacara, jacarilla*, taken from a Madrid Royal Chapel imprint of a year earlier
(E-Mn: VE/88/55).
Padilla likely kept his own collection of imprints (if not this actual
collection) as sources for composition, keeping current with the latest mainland
trends.

[^Puebla-Seville-Binders-collection]:
It is part of a binder's collection of villancico imprints of the 1630s and
1640s from Seville.
The volume is held in an anonyous private collection in Puebla, and according to
Gustavo Mauleón Rodríguez, who is cataloging these holdings, this binder's
collection was originally bound with another collection of Seville villancicos
which is preserved in Puebla's Biblioteca Lafragua; both bear the firemark of
Puebla's Convento de la Merced and appear to be two parts of one original
volume.

If Jalón's villancico was a modernization of Santiago's, then, and the text was
available to Padilla in New Spain through the imprint, why did Padilla choose to
set Santiago's original text (or an older tradition similar to it) rather than
the new one set by Jalón?
One possibility is that Padilla specifically wanted to differentiate himself
from Jalón and associate himself more directly with Santiago.
With his setting of *Voces, las de la capilla*, Padilla may have been trying to
show that he, not Jalón, was the true successor to Santiago.

Santiago, Padilla, and Jalón were not only part of a professional network; their
relationships with other chapelmasters may be best understood in terms of
kinship.
Most Hispanic chapelmasters were priests or men of religious orders, under vows
of celibacy; but in many cases they established genealogical lineages through
their musical relationships.
All of these men learned their craft through apprenticeship, and all of them
passed on their learning in the same way once they became the *maestros*.
The links between these men and their elders began in boyhood: Padilla, for one,
fulfilled a common requirement of housing and educating his choirboys in his own
home. 
(More research is needed into likely high prevalence and impact of sexual abuse
in this environment.)
Chapelmasters were linked to their predecessors by a common practice of
assisting the incumbent in his final years, before succeeding to the position.
Parallel lines of succession with such interim assistantships in Puebla and
Sevilla are shown in table `ref:table:Puebla-Seville-MCs`.

(insert table `ref:table:Puebla-Seville-MCs`)
`label:table:Puebla-Seville-MCs`

In Padilla's case, he served first as as choirboy at Málaga Cathedral and then
apprentice to the local chapelmaster Francisco Vásquez (ca. 1602--1608).
[@Gembero:Padilla]
In 1628, after he had settled in New Spain, Padilla was selected to assist the
ailing chapelmaster of Puebla Cathedral, Gaspar Fernández.
He composed the villancicos for Corpus Christi in that year, probably both as a
way to fill in for Fernández and to prove his own mastery.
[@Cashner:Cards]
He then succeeded Fernández after he died.
<!-- Fernández born in Guatemala, not Portugal -->
When Padilla's health began to fail in 1660, he signed a "power of attorney"
document giving legal rights to Juan García de Céspedes, a member of the Puebla
ensemble whose name appears throughout Padilla's partbooks.
García then succeeded Padilla after his death in 1664.
[@Mauleon:PadillaCivil, XXX]

The Seville chapelmasters established a kinship-like lineage in the same way.
Francisco de Santiago first served as assistant in Alonso Lobo during his old
age in 1616. 
[@Stevenson:SantiagoF]
Santiago composed the *chanzonetas* (villancicos) for Christmas that year, and
then succeeded Lobo after his death in 1617.
When Santiago's time came and he was debilitated by a paralyzing medical
condition, the chapter called on Luis Bernardo Jalón to provide the music for
Christmas 1643, and Jalón inherited Santiago's position the following year.

In these cases the lines of succession were established either by the composers
themselves or by the cathedral chapters, surely with the older master's
approval, since all these composers had at least a year to orient and train
their successors.
But musicians could also voluntarily demonstrate kinship even when they were not
made direct heirs. 
Younger musicians could deliberately affiliate themselves with teachers and
paragons through composing musical homages: table `ref:table:Padilla-homages`
shows likely homage compositions related to Padilla's *Voces*.
Padilla competed in the *oposición* for his Málaga teacher Vásquez's position
but was bested by the Portuguese composer Estêvão de Brito (1577--1641).
[@Stevenson:BritoE]
Francisco Vidales, organist in Padilla's Puebla chapel, demonstrated his
affiliation to Padilla by writing a parody mass based on a motet by Padilla.
[@Koegel:Padilla: 
"The Puebla organist Francisco de Vidales used
Padilla's *Exultate justi in Domino* as the model for his parody *Missa super
Exultate*, and another connection between the two men is seen in Vidales's
addition of a tenor part to Padilla's *O Domine Jesu Christe*." XXX]
Dianne Goldman has documented a similar chain of homage in several stages of
reworking a Victoria motet at Mexico City Cathedral through the eighteenth
century.^[cite Goldman stile antico article]
Homage composition of this kind was a widespread way for composers to
demonstrate both real and aspirational kinship with a mentor, teacher, or
paragon.

(insert table `ref:table:Padilla-homages`)
`label:table:Padilla-homages`

It makes sense, then, that Jalón would adapt a text set by Santiago in a way
that presented him as Santiago's heir, acknowledging influence while also
setting himself apart.
The modifications in *Cantores de la capilla* suggest that Jalón represented a
new generation and a new style, and his music was likely in a newer style.
For the sixty-seven-year-old Padilla, who long ago had not been able to capture
the coveted position of Seville chapelmaster in 1616, setting the older text (in
any case one closer to that set by Santiago) may have established Padilla's
affinity for the older generation and its style.

This practice of affiliating oneself through musical homage may shed light on
the origins and meaning of Padilla's most performed piece of Latin-texted music
today, the *Missa "Ego flos campi"* for eight voices.[^Padilla-Ego-flos-campi]
The piece has been assumed to be a parody mass bassed on a lost motet *Ego flos
campi* by Padilla.
But John IV's catalog lists another *Missa "Ego flos campi" a 8*---by Francisco de
Santiago.
Moreover, the catalog specifies that Santiago's mass was based on the motet *Ego
flos campi a 8* by Nicolas Dupont, a Flemish composer in the Spanish Royal
Chapel.
[@JohnIV:Catalog, 417, caixão 34, no. 787: 
"Missas \[...\] Ego flos campi, a 8. *Ferta sobre hum Motette de Niculas du
Pont*"; @JohnIV:Catalog, 381, caixão 32, no. 767: "Ego flos campi, a 8, Niculas
du Pont. *De Nossa Senhora*."
Based on this connection, Robert Stevenson speculated that Santiago, like his
peer Diego de Pontac, studied with Nicolas Dupont during Santiago's time in
Madrid; -@Stevenson:SantiagoF.]
(Neither piece has been found.)
For Santiago to use this music by Dupont, who may have been one of his teachers
in Madrid, was to connect himself to the august lineage of Hapsburg
Franco-Flemish composers going back to Dufay and Ockeghem.
It is possible, then, that Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla's *Missa "Ego flos campi"*
is not based on his own motet, but on Santiago's mass of the same name, and that
this represents another instance of Padilla establishing his musical pedigree.

### "All Who Heard It Were Amazed"

The metamusical villancico provided composers an ideal opportunity to establish
their own position in a tradition of compositional and theological
ingenuity---of musical theology.
The next section will show another example of this, in eight known settings of
villancicos from the same textual family by a network of interrelated composers
across Spain and into the New World.

For this study, Padilla's *Voces* serves as the starting point for a trajectory
of "singing about singing" in seventeenth-century Spanish devotional music.
The poem and music represent sounding music---including the "present" music in
Puebla as well as the historical music of the angels and shepherds at
Bethlehem---as *musica instrumentalis*, fully in accord with the Neoplatonic
system known from Boethius and many other early modern sources.
The musical performance invites listeners to contemplate the higher forms of
music, and above all the theological "Music" of the incarnate Christ, bringing
God and Man into consonance and forming in his own body and voice the perfect
*musica humana*.

In singing this villancico about singing, the Puebla chapel choir drew its
listeners' attention to the fact that they were singing.
The musicians, and so encouraged listeners to contemplate the higher levels of
music.
The listener would have the opportunity to listen for the voice of the sphers,
the angels, and most importantly, of Christ himself through the voices of the
chapel choir.
These higher forms of music would be audible only by faith, through the present
cathedral music which was its echo.
The exhortation in the opening line means that the Puebla "chapel choir" is to
set its time and tuning based on these higher forms of music, and that listeners
are therefore invited to "pay attention" as well to the verbal and musical
riddles presented to them.
Far from being a one-off occasional piece or crowd-pleasing entertainment, and
rather than being a simple didactic piece explaining doctrine, the complex
poetic and musical structure provides an object for aesthetic reflection as a
spiritual discipline, even inviting detailed analysis.
^[XXX  dell'antonio ]

But in order to contemplate the piece in this way, the listener must be equipped
with both faith and knowledge: faith to seek the higher theological meaning
behind the words and music, and knowledge to understand it.
Obviously, Padilla's villancico is aimed at a sophisticated listening audience.
The poem's double and triple conceits, some of them based on references to Latin
Scriptural and liturgical texts, require extensive knowledge not only of
theology and literature, but also of technical music theory.
Likewise, many of Padilla's musical puns---such as singing *máxima* on a breve,
the thirty-three notes of the respuesta, and the quotation of the *tonus
peregrinus*---would probably be accessible only to the performers themselves, if
even they were paying close enough attention.
Given the realities of hurried rehearsal schedules and the practical mindset of
many performers then and now, much of this artistry would remain hidden, known
only to the composer himself.
Because of its clear text declamation and distinct contrasts of styles, the
piece would still leave an overall impression on the less attentive and educated
listener, connecting the voices of the chapel choir with the voices of
the Christmas angels and the mystery of Christmas.

In this way, the piece functions not only for intellectual contemplation but
also makes an affective appeal to bodily, communal reaction and participation.
This function fits with the instructions in the Roman Catechism that the mystery
of the Incarnation is more to be marvelled at than explained in words.
Similarly, Fray Luis concludes his model Christmas sermon with a *peroratio*
that invites his listeners to join their voices and hearts with the worshippers
at Bethelehem:

> But consider, that if the angels on that day sang and solemnized this mystery
> with *Glorias* and praises, giving thanks \[*gracias*\] for the redemption
> that came to us from heaven, even though they themselves were not the ones
> redeemed, what should we do who are redeemed?
> If they thus give thanks for the grace \[*gracia*\] and mercy given to
> strangers, what should those do who were redeemed and restored by
> it?
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 28; cf. @Bernard:Nativitate, 126B, Sermo IV, "Et ut
noveritis quo in loco solemnitatitis \[...\] in psalmis, coelestes illos
principes praevenire conjunctos psallentibus, in medio juvencularum
tympanistriarum."]

The theology of Christ as the *Verbum infans* that underlies this villancico is
central for understanding how Catholics believed sacred music to function.
In the Catholic theological tradition of Christmas, Christ as the eternal Word
of God became incarnate, not simply to communicate "words" from God, but to be
in his body the medium of communication itself, as well as the message.
The point of the Christmas liturgy, then, would not be simply to "hear about"
God, but to encounter the incarnate Christ in his flesh, through the sacrament
of the Eucharist.
Lapide cites St. Cyril to say that "symbolically, the manger is the altar, on
which Christ in the Mass by consecration is as though born and sacrificed"; and
St. John Chrysostom to conclude, "That which the Magi saw in the manger, in a
little hut, with much veneration and fear approached and adored, you perceive
the same thing not in the manger, but on the altar."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 672, on Lk. 2:
"Sic et S. Cyrillus in Caten. Symbolice præsepe est altare, in quo Christus in
Missa per consecrationem quasi nascitur et immolatur.
Unde S. Chyrs. in Catena: *Quod in præsepio videntes atque tugurio Magi, cum
multa veneratione ac timore accesserunt et adorarunt: tu idipsum non in
præsepio, sed in altari cernens, majorem istis brabaris exhibe pietatem*."]
This is the Christmas version of the central theological concept for Roman
Catholics, Christ's presence in the sacraments.
As Pope St. Leo the Great epitomized the theology, "that which was plainly
visible in our Savior, passed into the sacraments \[or signs, or mysteries\]."
[@Leo:SermonesPL, 398, Sermo II de Ascensione Domini:
"Quod itaque redemptoris nostri conspicuum fuit, in sacramenta transiuit."]

All the auditory elements of the service, from the reading of Scripture to the
singing of villancicos, could only point toward this physical sacramental
encounter.
But because of music's ability to work on the external sense of hearing and the
internal faculties of the memory via the ethereal medium of the voice,
devotional music could still play a special role for pious listeners---helping
them experience intellectually and affectively something of the wonder and
mystery of the Incarnation at Christmas.
The primary audience of this cultivated subgenre of metamusical villancico would
likely have been the cathedral chapter, who from their privileged position
within the architectural choir would have been best able to hear the verbal and
musical conceits, who had the education to understand the theological
background, and who participated fully in the liturgy by communing.

By contrast, since the laity in Puebla and across the Hispanic world would have
been unlikely actually to receive the elements, the common parishioner's
relationship to the *admirabile sacramentum* was primarily to look (*admirar*),
to listen, and to adore.

Padilla's 1657 villancico would have been performed facing a high altar retable
on which the actual altar was flanked by an image of the Adoration of the
Shepherds on the left and the Visitation of the Magi on the right (figure
`ref:fig:Puebla-Ferrer-Retablo`).
This "Altar of the Kings" was completed by Pedro García Ferrer and consecrated
by bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza in 1649, thus places images of human
encounters with the incarnate Christ at the closest visual proximity to the
altar and central Eucharistic tabernacle.

Above these images, the eye is drawn upward to ascend into heaven along with
the Virgin Mary, for Catholics the paragon of true faith and devotion, through a
"celestial hierarchy" (to use the influential concept of Dionysius) into a realm
of baby angels playing musical instruments like harp and organ, through a
group of cherubim dancing in the round, to the Holy Trinity at the highest
point (figure `ref:fig:Puebla-Ferrer-BMV`).

Like Palafox's own devotional book *El Pastor de Nochebuena*, these images
invite worshippers to imagine themselves journeying with the shepherds and
Gentiles to meet Christ in his lowly incarnation as an infant.
[@Palafox:Nochebuena]
In Catholic devotional culture of this time, the goal of contemplating Christ's
birth was to cultivate faith in Christ, including both faith as belief and faith
as action or faithfulness.
Lapide, who had Ferrer paint his image as one of the shepherds on the Puebla
retable (figure `ref:fig:Puebla-Ferrer-Pastores`), holds up the shepherds to
his readers as an example of faith: they heard the angel chorus and saw the sign
of Christ in his manger, and then they went and told everyone, and as Luke 2:29,
"they went forth praising and glorifying God for everything they had seen and
heard."
Lapide says Christmas shepherds were chosen as the first outside Holy Family and
the stable animals to see the newborn Christ because in their own humble poverty
they would not be put off by Christ's lowly birth.
For "however many might have approached the manger, and seen Christ, but only
those could have believed in Christ, whose hearts God had effectively moved;
while the others, taking offense at Christ's poverty, would have spurned him."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 677, on Lk. 2: 
"Hinc patet pastores multis narrase eq quæ de Christo nato ab angelo adierant et
viderant: quare multos præsepe adiise, Christumque vidisse; sed eos solos in
Christo credidisse, quorum Deus corda efficaciter tangebat, ceteros offensos
paupertate Christi eum sprevisse."]
The shepherds not only heard and saw, but believed because they freely received
the gift of faith, as Lapide explains in his commentary on John 1:12 (with a
polemical eye on his Calvinist compatriots in the Low Countries): 
"God gives the power to become sons of God to those who freely receive Christ by
faith and obedience, excluding those who do not with to receive him."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 882: 
"Hoc est enim quot ait hic St. Joanes, Deum dedisse potestatem filios Dei his
qui libere Christum per fidem et obedientiam receperunt, exclusis iis, qui eum
recipere noluerunt."]

If the listeners were to imitate the shepherds, then, they would not only listen
for the angelic choirs and look for Christ's presence sacramentally on the
altar, but they would allow God to  move their hearts to receive him in
faith---a faith that could motivate them to witness their faith to others, as
the shepherds did.
Christmas villancicos like Padilla's *Voces* and the related family of
metamusical pieces discussed in the next section appealed to the hearing of
worshippers on several levels, and opened the possibility for them to listen in
faith for the voices of angels and the voice of Christ.
Through compositional craft, the musical performance could also move listeners'
hearts to wonder and adoration.

We have identified two main functions for this villancico, and others like it:
first, as an object of devotion; and second, as a means of establishing a
musical pedigree.
These contrasting functions may be harmonized somewhat by remembering the
theological emphasis on wonder, amazement, even "stupefaction" (to use Lapide's
term) in response to the voices of Christmas and the voice of the Word made
flesh.
In Luke's account, the shepherds are struck with terror when the angel speaks to
them; when the shepherds tell what they heard (presumably to Mary and Joseph
in the stable), "all who heard were amazed," both at the shepherds' words and
those the shepherds had heard from the angels.
The Virgin Mary, in turn, "treasured all these things \[*verba*\] within her
heart."
<!-- verses -->
If the goal of Christmas music in seventeenth-century Puebla and Seville was to
echo those historical voices of Christmas and provoke the same kind of awestruck
wonder, then this justifies poets and chapelmasters' efforts to impress and even
confound hearers through ingenious auditory artistry.
Listeners' relationship to a villancico like *Voces, las de la capilla* would
mirror their relationship to the mysterious and logic-defying theology of the
Incarnation: those who understood little could still be amazed greatly; those
who strained to understand more would only find themselves more in awe.
