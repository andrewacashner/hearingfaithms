# Listening for Unhearable Music

## Christ as Singer and Song

The majority of villancicos that take music as their central conceit are based
on themes of heavenly music.
Within the Spanish literary tradition of *conceptismo*, in which, under a
single governing conceit, a poem may be read in two or more ways simultaneously,
these metamusical pieces create a parallel discourse on music and theology by
playing on the rich symbolic heritage of musical words and concepts.
In the terms of Boethius, these pieces use *musica instrumentalis* to point
beyond themselves to higher forms of music---to the *musica humana*, the
harmony of body and soul, and of human society; *musica mundana*, the
harmony of the planetary and astral spheres; and even beyond the material world,
to the music of the *cielo Empyreo*.
In the Empyrean (English *Heaven* instead of *heavens* or sky), these
pieces evoke the song of saints and angels, and even the mysterious harmonies of
the Godhead: three persons in one Trinity, and the two natures of Christ as
man and God.

By tracing families and lineages of related villancicos on themes of heavenly
music, part II allows us to see how the
musical theology of villancicos developed over the course of the seventeenth
century, and the shifting ways that poets, composers, and listeners understood
the spiritual power of music to link hearing and faith.
The pieces interpreted in these case studies all challenge hearers to listen for
something more than human sounds; indeed, as these pieces reflect and reinforce
a Neoplatonic theology of music, they invite devotees to listen for unhearable
music, a music that defies human imagining, which creates harmony between the
human community and the divine.

Metamusical villancicos played a special role for Spanish composers as a kind of
self-imposed *oposición* or proof piece.
This type of piece offered them the opportunity to showcase their compositional
craft and theological insight. 
By adapting poetry or music previously used by a teacher, predecessor, or rival,
a composer could stake out his place in a tradition that was both artistic and
theological.
On the artistic level composers developed tropes for musical
self-representation, vying with each other for the most overt, symbolically
meaningful, and moving displays of musical artifice.
As part of a theological tradition, the pieces on themes of heavenly music
manifest changing ways of thinking about the relationship between earthly music
and heavenly or divine music, in the midst of shifting early modern
understandings of the cosmos, the human body, and society.

This chapter analyzes and interprets two families of villancicos that represent
Christ as both singer and song.
The first is *Voces, las de la capilla*, set by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla
for Puebla Cathedral in 1657, which is connected to two other known settings of
similar texts.
The second is *Suspended, cielos, vuestro dulce canto*, one of the
best-attested families of villancicos, with eight documented settings of variant
poetic texts in the later seventeenth century; the one extant complete musical
setting is by Joan Cererols, probably for the Escolania of Montserrat, around
1660.
These villancicos for Christmas connect incarnation, voice, and creation, as
they invite hearers to contemplate human music-making as a reflection of
Christ's nature as the divine "Word made flesh" (Jn 1).
Both textual traditions build on a patristic trope of Christ as
*Verbum infans*---the infant, or unspeaking Word, who does not need to
speak because God is already communicating himself to humankind through the
Christ-child's incarnate body.
The villancicos set by Padilla and Cererols turn this into musical theology by
imagining the baby Jesus not speaking, but singing; and by considering Christ
himself as the song being sung.
Thus the pieces, I argue, connected faith and hearing by making Christ the Word
audible through poetic and musical structures.


### "Voices of the Chapel Choir" and the "Unspeaking Word"
(Gutiérrez de Padilla)

In the setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* by Juan Gutiérrez de
Padilla, the first of two choruses in the polychoral ensemble of Puebla
Cathedral begins with this admonition: 

> Voices of the chapel choir,  
> keep count with what is sung,  
> for the King is a musician,  
> and takes note of even the most venial dissonances,  
> after the manner of David the monarch,  
> just as in the manner of Jesus the infant prince.

As the voices declaim these words together like a solemn choral recitative, 
breaking the chordal texture only for a mild dissonant suspension on the words
"light dissonances," the other chorus is literally counting
twenty-seven measures of rests until their entrance.

Thus begins a tour-de-force of music about music, in which the composer and his
ensemble take a verbal discourse about music and turn it into a musical
discourse about music.
Moreover, even as this discourse is referring through music to the music that is
currently being performed and heard, this discourse is not only about sounding
music or *musica instrumentalis*.

When the first chorus refers to "what is sung," they are not merely
referring to this literal level of human performance.
Instead, they point to *Jesús infante*---the child who is both
the *infante* or heir of the musician-king David and who is also God made
flesh as an infant, a child too young to be able to speak.

#### Christ as Music in the Poem

Any consideration of this complex piece should begin with a careful reading of
the poetic text and listening to the musical setting (even better, singing or
playing it). 
[@Cashner:WLSCM32, XXX]
It will probably be readily apparent that this is a different type of
villancico entirely from the comic villancicos more commonly heard in recent
performances and recordings.
The poem, whose author is unknown, is so elaborately contrived that it may seem
completely unintelligible at the first encounter. 
There is, indeed, no simple way to approach the text: anywhere one starts one
immediately becomes tangled in a thicket of ambiguous references and cryptic
phrases, and it is not possible to understand the text fully without reading it
as the distillation of tropes and doctrines developed through centuries of
theological literature and liturgy.
The piece demands a high level of intellectual engagement to tease out the
intricate conceit, and may thus be compared with what Bernardo Illari describes
as "enigma" villancicos.
[@Illari:Polychoral, vol. 2, 304--308]

Part of its difficulty comes from the widespread influence of the poetry of Luis
de Góngora, who played a similar role for Spanish literature on both sides of
the Atlantic to that of Giambattista Marino in Italian letters, as the
originator of a new aesthetic (referred to as *barroco* by Spanish literary
scholars) that emphasized learned artifice and highly wraught dramatic effects.
<!--- as opposed to ... -->
Gongoresque poets like the author of *Voces* reveled in arcane plays
on words, contorted Latinate syntax, and multiple levels of meanings.
[@Gaylord:Poetry, 222--236; @Tenorio:Gongorismo; @Valbuena:Literatura, vol. 1,
1014--1061]

To begin simply, though, this poem represents the tradition of Spanish
*conceptismo*, in which the poet creates a sustained analogy between at
least two different things such that the understanding of each one informs the
other.
Here the two elements are music---specifically choral singing---and the
Incarnate Christ at his birth.

This may be easiest to see in the coplas.
One can read these two strophes solely on the one plane referring to Christ's
Incarnation and Passion, however elliptically.
My published translation attempts to convey some of the ambiguity of the
original; emphasizing one side of the conceit or other would lead to different
translations, of course.
In the first copla, the Christ-child gave a "wandering song" to the
Man---referring to the first man, Adam, being cast out of Paradise.
Christ "went up so high" in "sustained tones of
weeping"---suffering on the cross for human redemption.
Christ "arose on the eighth" day---a traditional way of referring to the
Sunday on the Resurrection---"in the triune."
[See the entries for the numbers eight and three in @Bongo:NumerorumMysteria and
@Ricciardo:CommentariaSymbolica.]

Reading this copla according to the other side of the conceit, the Christ-child
gave the *tonus peregrinus* chant formula to the Man, and, as a virtuoso
singer, "he went up so high" that "in a cry of sharps," he
"went up the octave in a trill."
The poet has selected musical terms with double meanings that allow listeners
with musical knowledge to think about theological concepts in a new way, and
vice versa.
For example, the sharp sign (*sustenido*) is used (as J. S. Bach would
later use it) as an icon of the cross; and musically also seems to suggest the
"strange" (another meaning of *peregrino*) quality of this song
of suffering.

The two words *peregrino tono* would have called up for educated
listeners a long tradition of using the chant *tonus peregrinus* to
symbolize the expectant wandering of sinful humanity waiting for the coming of
Christ, as Craig Wright has traced in medieval sources.
In an allegorical commentary on the liturgy, which was disseminated in
manuscript and print versions across the Hispanic world---including copies in
Puebla---Guillelmus Durandus called the whole time from the fall of Adam to the
birth of Christ, including the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness and
Babylonian captivity, the *tempus peregrinationis*.
[@Wright:Maze, 234]

An interpreter contemporary to Padilla, Cornelius à Lapide, extends the
"pilgrim" concept to the New Adam, Christ.
In a commentary also available in Puebla and throughout the Spanish Empire that
Christ, as the New Adam, was born like a "pilgrim" on a journey in a
borrowed stable.
Explaining the Greek word *eskēnosen* in John 1:14,
Lapide says "he set up a tent or tabernacle in us, that is, among us, for
a short time, like a guest or pilgrim [*peregrinus*] in a foreign land," and
this should :teach us to be pilgrims [*peregrinos*] on earth, though
actually citizens of heaven."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 884: 
"Hoc est tentorium vel tabernaculum fixit in nobis, id est, inter nos, ad
modicum tempus, quasi hospes et peregrinus in terra aliena: erat enim ipse
civis, incola et dominus cœli ac paradisi [...]; 669, on Luke 2:5: "ut doceret
nos in terra esse peregrinos, cives vero cœli, ut ab hoc exilio magnis virtutum
passibus tendamis in cœlum, ceu patriam et civitatem nostram."] 
A contemporary musician, the composer and theorist Andrés Lorente, took up  the
"pilgrim song" trope, drawing on Vulgate Psalm 118:54, when he exhorted the
aspiring musician to match the music of his compositions with "the
spiritual Music of his person, cleansing his conscience, and rejoicing his soul
with Divine Music, so that he may say with David, *Cantabiles mihi erant
iustificationes tuæ in loco peregrinationis meæ* (Your right precepts have served
as songs for me in the place of my wanderings)."
[@Lorente:Porque, 609: 
"la Musica espiritual de su persona, limpiando su conciencia, y alegrando su
Anima con Musica diuina, para que pueda dezir con Dauid, *Cantabiles mihi*
[...].] 
Within this tradition, then, the villancico uses a chant tone to present
Christ himself as the song given to sinful Man in his pilgrimage.  
It is no surprise that in the musical setting, Padilla quotes the chant formula
literally, so that the symbol is present to the ear both in word and tone.

This rich interplay between the musical and theological sides of the
conceit extends throughout the whole villancico, opening up so many possible
points of reference and interpretations that it will not be possible here to go
through them all in detail, as I have done elsewhere.
[@Cashner:PhD, 133--203]
Instead it may be most helpful to give a brief summary of the poem's
representation of Christ as both singer and song.

The central conceit of the poem is to link the "voices of the chapel
choir"---the actual sounding music being heard in the performance of the
villancico---with a higher, theological Music with a capital M, namely, the
Christ-child himself.
The poem evokes the musical voices of human singers, angelic choirs, ancient
prophets, and even the crying voice of the newborn Christ. 
The second copla encapsulates the whole conceit: Christ is a divine musical
"composition," in which the divine chapelmaster "proves" 
his mastery at creating "consonances of a Man and God."[^estribillo-vs-emblems]

[^estribillo-vs-emblems]:
This is a common practice in villancicos: a puzzling idea presented at the
beginning of the piece is not fully explained until the end of the coplas,
so that when the estribillo is then repeated, the listener can hear it with
new understanding.
<!--- formal relationships here, diss p. 145 XXX -->
In many villancico poems, the relationship of estribillo and coplas is
similar to that between the image and accompanying texts in contemporary
emblem books (@Covarrubias:Emblemas).
In the emblem book of Covarrubias, the emblem is often striking but cryptic,
juxtaposing (for example) two well-known symbols in an unusual way, often
with a Latin motto.
On the facing page is a poem that expands on the ideas in the image, and on
the reverse of that page is a prose explanation of both the poem and the
image.
In this villancico text, then, the estribillo's function is similar to the
purpose of the emblem and poem as presenting attention-getting but enigmatic
symbols, while the coplas share the more explanatory function of the emblem
book's prose. 
Just as one would read the explanation and then turn back to consider the
emblem again, now with a heightened sense of meaning, so too in the
villancico, when the estribillo is repeated after the coplas, listeners have
the opportunity to reconsider what they have heard in light of the coplas. 


The "chapel," it would seem, is performing before the king, like the
Spanish *Capilla Real*; and this King, that is, God, "is a
musician."
His only-begotten son---his royal *infante*---is this divine
chapelmaster's *oposición* or proof piece, in which he demonstrates his
mastery by creating concord between opposed elements.
Christ brings together infinite and finite ("maxima and breve"), and
creates a consonance to restore the discordant relationship between sinful Man
and the holy God by reconciling both in his own body.

On the theological side of the conceit, who exactly is this king who is
listening so carefully to the chapel choir's voices?
The poet explicitly connects the king to "David the monarch," the paragon
of Biblical musicians as both the traditional author of the psalms and as the
founder of the first musical ensemble for worship in the ancient Hebrew
temple.
<!--- source -->
Calling Jesus *infante* identifies this child as David's
heir---that is, as the Messiah; and the phrase *a lo de* (in the manner or
style of) suggests that this child will be no less exacting a musical taskmaster
than his ancestor.
There is also a deeper meaning to the term *infante* here, to which we will
return.

As the poem continues, it presents Christ as the theological fulfillment of the
prophecies made to and through David, especially the psalms; in musical terms,
Christ's life "is putting notes to his lyrics" (ll. 8--9), and thus
his life is recounted cryptically with the technical vocabulary for describing a
musical composition or performance.
Theologically, God had promised to David an heir to sit on his throne forever
and deliver his people,
and through Isaiah the prophet he renewed this promise by saying that a child
would be born upon whose shoulder would rest divine, eternal
authority.
<!--- cite Is. 22:22 but note context --> 
As Biblical interpreters of the time all agreed, the complete fulfillment of
these prophecies, the culmination of all God's "centuries of heroic
exploits" (l. 8) came not at Christ's birth, but at his death and
resurrection, traditionally thirty-three years (and three months and three days)
later.
<!--- mention ``A que el juego'' -->
In musical terms, the words of David and the prophets are just the lyrics;
Christ's life is the song.
The key of authority---*clave*---is the same word for clef; and it
awaits "the thirty-three," suggesting some kind of musical measure.

The second section of the introduction (ll. 11--16) depicts the moment of
Christ's birth as a musical performance. 
This happens "years before the sign, 'dexterity in hope'."
Since the poet has just referred to "the thirty-three" as a metonym for
Christ's passion, the *divisa*---a sign of any kind but particularly a
heraldic emblem or motto---may refer to the cross.
<!--- source -->
 others who say the same
The motto, *la destreza en la esperanza*, sounds like a gloss a phrase
from the Roman historian Tacitus, *spes in virtute*, which was cried in
the midst of a famous battle.
<!--- source, details -->
The heraldic and chivalric imagery and language (*hazañas*,
*destreza*) here continues the notion of Christ as a
David-like hero; but in the musical context it also established Christ as a
musical virtuoso.
The term *destreza* was commonly used in Spanish musical writing to
denote virtousity and consummate craftsmanship; it could be used both for
players and for composers.
<!--- source -->

In the next lines we begin to hear this musician's song, and the theological and
musical come too close to cleanly separate.
The solmization syllables *sol* and *mi* here indicate musical
pitches, as well as the symbolic puns on "sun" and "me."
The "Gloria" of the angelic choirs begins "on *sol*," as many
Gregorian *Gloria in excelsis* chants do; it also begins "with the
sun," a reference both to Christ's birth traditionally at midnight ("at
the half-measure of night", l. 15) and a symbol of his royalty, the same
symbol used by Spain's own king, Philip IV.
<!--- cite also Is. 60:1, connect Jn 1:14, Tit 2:11 -->
The reference to "glory" and "grace" here is part of a long
theological tradition which we will explore later.

<!--- or here -->

Now the poet turns even more strongly from using music as a metaphor to
describing actual music-making, as in the estribillo the text calls to mind the
whole creation of humans, animals (*hombres y brutos*, l. 20; also
the reference to birdsong in l. 16),
heavenly spheres (*las distancias*, a technical term in both astronomy
and music), all joining with the angels in the chorus to praise God made
Incarnate in their midst.
Like all poetry about music, this representation of music draws on the poet's
experience of actual, contemporary music---thus the spheres sing "in one
choir and the other," like Spain's polychoral ensembles.
The scene recalls many contemporary images of the Adoration of the Sheperds, in
particular one by Francisco de Zurbarán painted in Cádiz only a few years after
Padilla left it for the New World, and an engraving in a 1617 breviary
that both poet and composer are likely to have seen.
<!--- sources and dates -->

The phrase *grave, suave y sonoro* seems to have been a stock
description of sacred music appropriate for liturgical worship.
The same words are used to describe the music of Christ as a musician (in fact,
as a musical instrument) in José de Cáseda's *Qué música divina* from
a half-century later, as discussed in a later chapter. 
A bequest to Mexico City Cathedral in XXX used nearly identical
terms to describe the Latin Responsories that should be sung.
Interestingly, in that case the term was used to specify Latin-texted music
*as opposed to* villancicos.
<!--- cite Goldman, check detail -->
Here, within a villancico, the term is used to refer to a higher form of
music-making, within the Neoplatonic tradition of using that which is lowly to
point toward higher truths. 
We will see that Padilla uses stylistic topics to match the reference to
different types of music within the same piece.

The numbers here ("three by three, two by two, one by one") have a wide
range of possible symbolic meanings, while at the most literal level (the level
Padilla seizes on in his setting) it describes the number of voices in the
musical texture.
"Two by two" would seem to be a reference to the animals on Noah's Ark,
here referring not only to the animals in the stable, but also to the whole
scene as a picture of the Christian church, a symbolic connection going back to
the first century.
<!--- cite 1 Peter, Augustine -->
"Three by three" could be the nine ranks of angelic choirs, and
"one by one" could refer to humans or to Christ himself (particularly his
union of divine and human in a single body).
<!--- ? cite 9-fold angel choir -->

Thus far the poet has taken us from listening to the chapel choir singing in the
present, to the ancient temple choir of David and the voices of prophets through
the centuries, and up to the moment when the angels led the song of Gloria at
Christ's birth.
But all these voices, the poem now says, have been "awaiting the
opportune time, the one who was before all time" (ll. 24--25).
Once again, the true music of Christmas is Christ himself, and thus the next
lines represent the voice of the baby Jesus.
The musical imagery here continues the conceit of the King as musician, a
*padre* (father, priest) like most Spanish chapelmasters including Padilla,
who either sounds the pitch *A (la, mi, re)* in Guidonian solmization with
his voice as a tuning note (the same one used today), or sings an intonation on
that note as a cantor would do.
Another translation of the contorted syntax here might suggest that the poetic
speaker actually "heard the voice of the Father singing," that is,
*through* the voice of the child.
At this cue, the speaker says, he heard singing, not in *puntos de canto
llano* (plainchant) but *puntos de llanto* (weeping); this connects
Christ's cries at his birth with those at his death.
<!--- cite -->
The song is "as much to be seen (or admired) as to be
heard"---because the song and the singer are one and the same.

This interpretation depends on reading "the sign of *A (la, mi,
re)*" as a symbol of Christ himself.
The poem says the voices were all awaiting "the one who was
before all time," an appositive phrase referring to Christ, whom the Nicene
Creeds declares was "begotten of the father before all ages
[*secula*].
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 42: "ex patre natum ante omnia secula."]
The reference to Christ's eternal existence together with the letter A recalls
Christ's description of himself in the Revelation to John as
"*alpha* and *omega*"---the Vulgate simply puts the Greek
letter A here.[^alpha-omega]
This title indicates that Christ is "the beginning and the end,"
"the one who is and who was and who is to come" (Rev. 1:8,
21:6, 22:13).[^Rev1-8]
The time symbolism works on a musical level as well, but the "sign of A"
also suggests the musical pitch A.

[^alpha-omega]:
This is an especially interesting choice since the Greek text of
Rev. 1:8, actually spells out *alpha* (but not *omega*).

[^Rev1-8]:
In both Greek and Latin, the phrase in Revelation 1:8 repeats exactly
the words used for the name of God (the Hebrew tetragrammaton, *YHWH*) in
the translations of Ex. 3:14 into those languages (Greek
*hō ōn*, Latin *qui est*).

The final couplet epitomizes the theology of Incarnation through a play on
rising and falling musical lines: "Everything in Man is to ascend/ and
everything in God is to descend" (ll. 32--33).
Most discussions of the Incarnation in contemporary theological literature cited
some version of the maxim attributed to St. Ambrose, "God became Man
so that Man might become Divine."
<!--- check source, cite -->
In Christ, God humbled himself so that he might raise up sinful humans to share
in his glory (Philippians XXX). 
This central theology of Christianity is represented in the poem through the
musical concept of a contrapuntal voice exchange.

The villancico began by drawing listeners' attention to the voices of Christmas,
and exhorting the singing voices of the chapel choir to take note of their own
singing while also listening for "what is sung" on a higher level.
The piece connects Christ and David as musician-kings, with Christ as the song
that puts the prophetic "lyrics" of David and other Scriptural authors to
music.
After long waiting, at the "opportune time," Christ was born into the
world to begin a battle "in hope," a virtuoso performance fulfilled in
his death and resurrection at "the thirty-three," upon the "sign"
of the cross.
Christ himself is the incranate Word, and his infant cries are the true
"sign of A," the "song" that sets the tone for all the other
voices, "in one choir and another" of the Christmas manger, and at the
Christmas liturgy in the present-day of the villancico's performance.

#### Music about Music in the Voices of Puebla's Chapel Choir

How, then, does the composer turn the musical-theological conceits of this poem
into actual *musica instrumentalis*?

In any example of sung poetry, we may distinguish three aspects of text setting:
text projection, depiction, and expression.
<!--- cite Burkholder for the latter two -->
In text projection, a composer projects the words clearly according to their
prosody and grammatical structure, and sets them to memorable melodic and
rhythmic patterns, so that listeners can hear and understand the words of the
poem.
In text depiction, a composer uses musical techniques (in this period, often
musical-rhetorical figures) to paint or represent the meaning of the text in a
symbolic way, such as in madrigalisms.
Text expression encompasses a variety of ways that a composer can communicate
the feeling, mood, and meaning of the text to listeners, including the use of
affective or other stylistic topics or anything that makes the listener feel and
experience the meaning of the text.

Padilla's setting of this poem is a tour-de-force of text depiction, but it
also demonstrates careful attention to text projection.
This approach fits with an aesthetic of Tridentine clarity in presenting the
text, as well as with traditions from Spanish popular and theatrical traditions
of singing poetry, especially traditions of adapting stock melodic formulas for
singing *romance* poetry.
<!--- cite -->

##### Text Projection

The formal structure of the musical setting is closely linked to that of the
poem.
[@Cashner:WLSCM32, XXX]
The poem begins with an introductory section, which will be useful to label
*introducción* as many poetry imprints of other villancicos do.
The *introducción* consists of two six-line strophes, each followed by the
same *respuesta* or response of a four-line strophe.
The placement of rests and repeat markings in the performing parts makes clear
that the *respuesta* is sung after each of the six-line
strophes.
<!--- distinguish from other edition, performance -->
The whole *introducción* is in the poetic meter of *romance* in
*-a -a*: this means that every line is eight syllables long, and that there
is assonance in the last two vowels of the even-numbered lines.
<!--- cite metrica -->
Thus the poem uses *-a -a* assonance in *canta*,
*disonancias*, *monarca*, and so on.

Another way to think of *romance* poetry is more similar to traditional
poetic forms in other languages, such as Old English and Germanic poetry---as
sixteen-syllable lines, with a *caesura* in the middle and assonance at the
end.
<!--- cite crestomatia, romance publications, Old English, German exx -->
In other words, the beginning of this villancico would probably have been
arranged like this (partly because of narrow columns in the typographical
layout):

> Voces, las de la capilla,  
> cuenta con lo que se canta,  
> que es músico el rey, y nota  
> las más breves disonancias  
> a lo de Jesús infante  
> y a lo de David monarca.

But it could also be arranged like this:

-------------------------       ----------------------------
Voces, las de la capilla,       cuenta con lo que se canta,
que es músico el rey, y nota    las más breves disonancias
a lo de Jesús infante           y a lo de David monarca.
--------------------------      ----------------------------

Padilla sets the text as though it were arranged in the latter way: he pauses
briefly where the *caesurae* would be, but punctuates the assonant lines
with clear points of harmonic arrival.
He articulates the end of the strophes in the *introducción* with full
cadences.

Padilla begins the piece with the voices of the first choir moving together
rhythmically to declaim the words in something like choral recitative.
Padilla arranges the phrases so that the singers present the lines in pairs,
with emphasis on the assonant even-numbered lines.
The composer has paid close attention to details of accentuation and diction.
He sets the first two lines of poetry (mm. 1--10) with relatively long
note values on the stressed syllables, creating a deliberate, careful tone that
embodies the poetic exhortation to "pay attention" to what is sung. 

He has the chorus sing the first word, *Voces*, beginning
on the second subdivision of the ternary measure, with three minims for the
first syllable and two for the second. 
Since the word ends on S and is an invocation, it would make sense to have the
singers make a small break between mm. 2--3, placing the S sound on the
last minim of m. 2 or just after.
This allows the word to be sung in a way that matches the natural quantities of
its two syllables and that projects its grammatical structure in the opening
sentence of the poem.
That first word, in a common device of Padilla's villancicos, is sung on the
second minim of the measure: thus the leader could conduct the downbeat, cuing
the singers to breathe, and then the chorus would sing their entrance, which
because of its high tessitura and irregular, offbeat rhythms, seems to hang
mysteriously in the air.
The word *cuenta* (m. 6) is also sung on the second minim of the
measure and is then held for three minims, syncopated across the downbeat.
After this long not, like pulling back a spring, the metrical pattern is
released and the voices flow in even, regularly accented minims on *con
lo que se canta*.
For the next phrase (*que es músico el rey*) Padilla creates the effect
of an interjection, breaking the rhythmic pattern and beginning this phrase,
like the others, on the second minim of the measure.

The rest of Padilla's setting is as meticulously crafted as this opening phrase
on the level of text projection.
Another example is the interjection *¡O qué canto!*, which Padilla
starts on the last minim of the measure before the previous phrase has finished,
exactly as an interjection should.

His setting of the estribillo is more madrigalistic---that is, more driven by
text depiction---but still closely follows the natural accentuation patterns of
the poetry.
Aside from the symbolic meanings of the two changes of meter (m. 45 and
m. 60; see below), these shifts match the stress patterns implicit in
these sections of poetry.

At a larger scale, the piece's harmonic structure coordinates with the form of
the poem.
The piece is in mode I, in *cantus mollis*---that is, the one flat in the
key signature transposes the mode up a fourth; the final is on G and the Tenor
parts have a mostly authentic ambitus.
The internal cadences in the *introducción* are on G (m. 19), D
(m. 27), and G (m. 44); and the cadences at the end of the
estribillo and of both coplas are also on G. 
These cadence points are in line with the prescriptions of contemporary
theorists for modal counterpoint, while also punctuating the
sections of the poem and making its grammatical and rhetorical structure clear
to listeners.

##### Text Depiction

It is on the level of text depiction---representing the meaning of the text
through musical figures and symbols---that Padilla demonstrates his full mastery
of his craft by presenting an intricate discourse about music through music
itself.
As we have noted, the opening invocation to the "Voices of the chapel
choir, keep count with what is sung" is voiced by one division of the polychoral
ensemble while the other chorus literally counts its rests until its entrance in
the *respuesta*.
The first chorus sings the word *cuenta* on a long, offbeat note, a
blackened, dotted semibreve (that is, artificially perfected) that leaps off the
page as a visual indication to the singer to "keep count," and makes a
clear audible symbol as well.
Padilla sets "the lightest dissonance" in mm. 14--19 by having the
Altus I suspend across the first minim of m. 18, making a dissonant
seventh against the Tenor's A---this forms a light dissonance that quickly
resolves to F sharp and then to a cadence on G in m. 19.
On the repeat of this section, it is easy to imagine that an experienced trble
singing about "the trills of the dawn" in mm. 25--27 would have
improvised a trill on the suspension at this cadence.
[See Cerone's isntructions for improvisng ornaments at cadences,
@Cerone:Melopeo, 545--546.]
In the *respuesta*, where Chorus II sings about awaiting "the
thirty-three," Padilla writes precisely thirty-three pitches for both of the
sung vocal parts.

Where the poem says that the whole world was "waiting" for "the
sign"---that is, the Incarnate Christ---in Padilla's setting, that sign comes
with the estribillo in m. 45, where the C meter sign indicates a shift
to duple meter, after which the musicians shift from the declamatory style of
the introduction to a more regular rhythmic pattern, moving together in
*corcheas* (modern eighth notes).
Here Padilla depicts what the words say by building up a point of imitation
"from one choir to the other" (mm. 45--50) and then creating
polychoral dialogue (mm. 51--59).
Padilla sets the numbers in the poem literally: three performers for
*tres a tres*, two for *dos a dos*, and one for *uno a uno*.

The style of this section, contrasting with that of the introduction, is like
that of a madrigal (`(ref float 'music 'Padilla-Voces-madrigal)`).
The madrigal *As Vesta Was from Latmos Hill Descending* by Thomas Weelkes (1601)
uses the same technique to depict similar words, possibly reflecting a common
Italian model.[^Weelkes]
This section, then, is "music about music" in yet another sense, as Padilla refers
to other genres and styles of music within one villancico.
As the poem depicts the actual singing performed at the firs Christmas, Padilla
uses a style that evokes and embodies convivial group singing.
The angels, planets, shepherds, and animals around the créche are represented
not only as singing in the abstract---they are singing a madrigal.

[^Weelkes]: 
Weelkes's madrigal was published in Thomas Morley's *The Triumphes of Oriana*
(London, 1601), but there is little evidence that English music circulated in
Spain or its colonies.

`(insert float 'music 'Padilla-Voces-madrigal)`

Padilla's musical scene matches contemporary Nativity images that portray
music-making around the manger. 
Padilla's Andalusian compatriot Francisco de Zurbarán depicted two levels of
music in his *Adoration of the Shepherds*, painted for the high altar of the
Carthusian monastery of Jerez de la Frontera in 1638--1639
(`(ref float 'figure 'Zurbaran-Jerez-Adoracion)`).
In heaven above, angels sing to the accompaniment of the harp, while below,
another angelic consort joins the company of worshippers in the stable, and they
sing to the accompaniment of the lute.
In Spain the harp was associated with both heavenly music and earthly church
music (see chapter 5), and the lute, with musical genres performed outside of
church, such as the madrigal. 
Villancicos crossed both domains, and therefore could incorporate references to
both styles within them---much as Zurbarán's painting incorporates aspects of
genre painting, the representation of earthy details from everyday life, into a
representation of sacred history.
[@Sanchez:Zurbaran, 31; @Cherry:Bodegon; @Haraszti-Takacs:Genre]
Both visual and musical forms of crossover were especially fitting to represent
the Christmas moment when the "maxima" and "breve," high and low, were brought
together, and the music of the heavenly chorus broke through to be heard by
humble shepherds.
Zurbarán's image, in line with other contemporary iconography like the manger
scene in a 1613 Roman Breviary and the Adoration of the Shepherds on the retable
of Puebla Cathedral, includes a bound lamb next to the manger as a symbol of
Christ's fate as the paschal lamb, much as "the thirty-three" and other
references in this villancico connect Christ's birth to his sacrificial
death.[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, 168] 
<!--- Puebla cathedral book or image in this book -->

`(insert float 'figure 'Zurbaran-Jerez-Adoracion)`

At the phrase *y aguardan tiempo oportuno* ("and they await the opportune time,"
m. 60), Padilla shifts meter signatures again, returning to ternary meter (CZ)
with a new lilting rhythmic pattern. 
This creates a sense of arrival in a new *tiempo*, which then abruptly halts at
the end of the phrase, *quien antes del tiempo fue* ("the one who was before
time", mm. 63--65).
As Christ is "the beginning and the end" (Rev. XXX), this halt is fitting.
Lorente says the term *tiempo* can denote the meter and the symbol that sets the
meter.[@Lorente:Porque, bk. 2, 149]
Thus, since Christ existed before all time theologically, Padilla puts this
phrase "before the time signature" musically.

The musical conceipts in the next lines of poetry shift the focus from rhythm to
melody, as the poem uses solmization symbols: *por el signo a la mi re, puestos
los ojos en mi* (upon the sign of *A (la, mi, re)*, with eyes set on
me/*mi*).
Likewise, Padilla's metamusical conceits play on the musical terms in the most
literal sense, realizing the solmization syllables in several ways at the same
time (`(ref float 'figure 'Padilla-Voces-alamire)`).
Both Altus I and Tenor I sing the word *a* on the pitch *A (la, mi, re)* (m.
67). 
On the words *la mi re* (mm. 68--69), the Tiple I sings the pitches D--C♯--D: in
the soft hexachord the D would in fact be *la*; then the written sharp on C
would alter it to a *mi* in *musica ficta*; and the final D could be *re* in the
natural hexachord.
On the same words, the Tenor sings D--A--D: *la--mi* in the soft hexachord, then
*re* in the natural hexachord.
At the end of this phrase (m. 72), the performers of all three voices sing the
word *mi* by literally "putting their eyes on *mi*, with Tiple and Tenor on A
(*mi* in the soft hexachord) and Altus on E (*mi* in the natural hexachord).

`(insert float 'figure 'Padilla-Voces-alamire)`

Guidonian solmization was still a fundamental part of Spanish theory treatises
through the eighteenth century, and were used frequently enough that they came
to be used as the Spanish names for pitch-classes in the seven-note scale.
The prevalence of solmization practice is evidenced by both books intended for
specialists (Cerone) and those for beginners, such as the 1677 guitar primer of
Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz, as well as student notebooks in manuscript.
[@Ruiz:Luz; examples of manuscript student notebooks are in E-Bbc: M732/13--16;
see also @Cohen:NotesMiddleAges]
Even if fully trained singers did not often resort to the actual syllables in
reading music, they were trained in the system and could certainly have
recognized the Guidonian puns in this passage.

The next phrase evokes both singing and listening---*a la voz del padre oí cantar
por puntos de llanto* (I heard the father's voice singing in weeping
tones)---and on "I heard" (m. 77), all the voices cadence and then rest, as
though to stop and listen.
To create the effect of the interjection *¡O, qué canto!*, Padilla has the
second chorus enter on the last minim of the measure (m. 83), before the first
chorus has finished their phrase. 
The emphatic *O* in the succeeding passage may well be intended to contrast with
the *signo A (la, mi, re)*, marking Christ as *alpha* and *omega*.

In the final couplet of the estribillo (*Todo en el hombre es subir/ y todo en
Dios es bajar*, mm. 100--126), as the full chorus evokes the theological concept
of God's descent and humankind's ascent through the Incarnation, Padilla creates
a matching musical concept of contrasting ascending and descending gestures with
opposed rhythmic profiles.
In the first gesture, for Man ascending, the voices ascend stepwise in minims,
in a lilting ternary dotted rhythm.
this is first heard in Altus I and Tenor I, mm. 98--100, with the ascent
highlighted by having the Tenor move through F sharp.
In rhetorical terms this is *anabasis*.
In the second gesture, for God descending, all the voices move
downwards---*catabasis*---in emphatic duple rhythm with blackened semibreves,
including passing through added E flats (Chorus I, mm. 100--104).
The Tenor I has the highest number of blackened notes, singing a sequence of
descending fourths (mm. 100--103), then thirds (mm. 108--112), and finally
seconds (mm. 118--122) (`(ref float 'figure 'Padilla-Voces-TI-bajar)`).

`(insert float 'figure 'Padilla-Voces-TI-bajar)`

When Padilla juxtaposes these ideas in the full polychoral texture, listeners
can hear the fusion of both rising and falling melodic lines, and two different
rhythmic systems---the duple-compound *sesquialtera* rhythm of "Man ascending"
and the triple-simple rhythm of "God descending."
In the final cadence, the Altus I combines the two gestures at once by singing
the words "everything in God is to descend" to the music associated with "Man
ascending" (mm. 124--126).
The passage embodies the central theology of the Incarnation: through God's
descent to become Man in Christ, Man may ascend to share in God's nature.
<!--- patristic sources for this -->

Each of the two poetic coplas centers on a concept from music theory: the first
plays with the notion of *peregrino tono* ("wandering song," or the plainchant
*tonus peregrinus*); the second, on the contrasting rhythmic values of *la
máxima y breve*.
True to form, Padilla sets *peregrino tono* to a fragment of the actual
plainchant tone.
The last psalm tone was known in Latin sources as the *tonus peregrinus* and in
Spanish sources as *tono irregular* or *tono mixto*. 
Its final cadence is a rising minor third followed by a stepwise descent to the
final (`(ref float 'figure 'Cerone-tonus-peregrinus)`). <!--- p. 354) -->
In *cantus durus* this is D--F--E--D; if notated in the *cantus mollis*
transposition of this villancico, the pitches would be G--B♭--A--G, which are
exactly what the Altus I sings on these words (mm. 128--129).
The same motive of the a leap up followed by a descending third is then imitated
in the Tenor I and Tiple I on F--E--D, the *durus* version.

<!--- cautionary F# as "strange tone"? -->

In the last phrase of this copla, when the poem speaks of Christ "going up the
octave" or theologically "ascending on the eighth day", Padilla creates an
octave ascent across the voices, with the Tenor leaping D~4~--G~4~ and the Tiple
continuing, G~4~--D~5~.
This octave also plays into the symbolism of the *tonus peregrinus*, since
Cerone says that Spanish writers call this "eighth" psalm tone *octavo
irregular*.[@Cerone:Melopeo, 354]

The second copla emphasizes rhythm, using the *máxima* and *breve*, in medieval
theory the longest and shortest note values, to point to the union of eternal
and temporal, infinite and finite in the incarnate Christ as the divine
chapelmaster's "composition."
Padilla presents the basic concept of long versus short note values through the
lengthened note on *máxima* in the Tenor (mm. 153--154) over a long held note
in the Bassus (mm. 154--155).
Ironically, each of these long notes is actually a breve.
How better to express the unity between these opposites than by vocalizing the name
for one while singing the value of the other?
The Altus echoes with a blackened semibreve (mm. 154--155), which in this
context is a long note made shorter, getting at the same concept a different
way.
At a more arcane level, the whole first phrase of this coplas (mm. 147--156) is
ten compases long, which is precisely equal to the length of a true maxima
(eight measures in C3) plus a breve (two measures).

Padilla's setting as a whole is intimately connected to the sound and meaning of
the poetry.
Padilla has his chapel choir present the poem in a way that allows the words to
be heard clearly, reflecting their grammatical structure and the poem's dramatic
shape, while also embodying the conceits of the poetry in appropriate musical
symbols and even adding some musical puzzles of his own.

#### Theology of Christ as *Verbum infans*

<!---

- this piece comes from a deeper background of theology of Incarnation & voice
  related to Christmas; manifests tropes of Christmas - devotion to Christ *as*
  something rather than teaching that Christ *is* something
  + Liturgical context: admirabile sacramentum etc
  + Christmas preaching, exegesis
    - Verbum infans
    - (Grace & glory)
    - Alpha & O

-->

The villancico *Voces, las de la capilla* embodies the central tropes of
Christmas devotion in early modern Catholicism, while extending these traditions
by expressing them through the language and techniques of music.
In other words, the feast of Christmas centered on devotion to incarnation of
Christ as a child, the "Word made flesh"; this piece of devotional music
presents a poetic and musical discourse on Christ's incarnation by conceiving of
"the Word" in musical terms and then representing that concept in actual music.
Padilla's piece presents a new twist on a trope that extends back to Bernard of
Clairvaux and further to Augustine---that of Christ as *Verbum infans*, "the
unspeaking/infant Word."
This trope continued to be turned and refined through the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and can be found in Christmas sermons and exegetical
commentaries on the Gospel infancy narratives that were widely available in
Padilla's day and that would have been familiar to a university-educated priest.

The festival of Christmas had first developed from regionally varying annual
celebrations of Christ's birth and beginnings, and solidified as a formal
observance among the church communities of fourth-century Rome.
[@Talley:LiturgicalYear, 85--140; @Bradshaw:EarlyWorship, 86--89;
@Roll:OriginsChristmas]
The customary readings and chants from Scripture developed alongside the other
customs of Christmas throughout the medieval period.
While it may be more conventional to label these traditions "doctrines" or
"dogmas" (particularly after Trent), they represent more than officially
codified propositions.
Rather, the tropes of Christmas include not only doctrinal concepts like the two
natures of the incarnate Christ as divine and human, but extend also to
attitudes, affects, frames of mind---all the cultural practices that go into
making the festival "feel like Christmas," the "proper ways of worshipping" (one
etymology of the term *orthodoxy*) that characterize this particular
celebration.[^feasts-and-seasons]

[^feasts-and-seasons]:
@Grimes:Beginnings, 54--62, identifies distinct but interlinked ritual modes of
"liturgy" and "celebration."
Scholars of ritual studies and Christian liturgical theology have consistently
argued that liturgy does more than promulgate doctrines, but musicological and
philological studies of post-Tridentine religious arts have not always paid
enough attention to the insights of these fields.
For an influential modern Catholic theology of the function of liturgical
feasts, see @Taft:LiturgicalYear, 3--4, 12--23.
<!--- ***** -->

These tropes contributed to what might be called a Christmas imaginary, the
contents of which one may see restated and endlessly varied not only in
villancicos but also painted and sculpted on Spanish church walls and printed in
the text and illustrations of contemporary theological books.
The visual and performing arts preserved in such historic sources represent only
a portion of the lively variety of customary social practices connected with the
feast---gift-giving, traditional foods, popular songs from oral tradition.
both official sources like the liturgy, creeds, catechisms, commentaries, and
homilies as well as unofficial popular devotion drew from and contributed to a
commmon fund of Christmas tropes, which by the seventeenth century was filled to
overflowing.
The function of early modern Catholic feasts was not so much to teach people
that Christ *is* something, as to cultivate to devotion to Christ *as*
something.
The goal was doxology more than doctrine.

Though oral tradition was probably still the most important force in cultivating
the Christmas imaginary in early modern Spain, printed theological literature
disseminated and reinforced these tropes in Padilla's day and makes them
accessible today.
The Christmas liturgy provided the foundation for the theology behind this
trope, through the way the ritual texts framed the interpretation of
Scripture within the Church's exegetical traditions.
Certain passage of Scripture treating Christ's birth, his Messianic identity,
and the theology of incarnation became classic Christmas *loci theologici*
through the mutually reinforcing practices of, first, reading and singing these
passages in the developing Christmas liturgy, and, second, interpreting these
passages in preaching and commentaries.
[On patristic exegesis and its relationship to later interpretve traditions, see
@Kannengiesser:PatristicExegesis; @McKim:BiblicalInterpreters;
@Thompson:ReadingwDead.]

For example, the tradition of beginning the series of psalms in the Christmas
Matins liturgy with Psalm 2 was influenced by the interpretation of that psalm
as a Messianic prophecy in patristic exegesis---such as the sermons of Pope St.
Leo the Great, Pope St. Gregory the Great, and St. Ambrose, which were included
in Matins as the lessons of the second and third Nocturnes. 
Moreover, the Scripture's placement in this liturgical context in turn
reinforced the Messianic interpretation.
Padilla's villancico was performed in the midst of these Scriptures and
patristic preaching, as well as contemporary preaching in the vernacular; it
should be understood as amplifying, extending, and even playing with the
Christmas tropes in those other sources.

<!--- catechism, cur Deus incarnatus, foundation of Christmas belief and
devotion (Christ "is" and Christ "as"; God's action in Incarnation and our
response in wonder and adoration)
then right to Verbum infans as bridge between the theological concept and
possibility of musical conceit
-->

The foundation of the Christmas feast was devotion to "Jesus Christ, [God's]
only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin
Mary," as stated in the Apostle's Creed, which in turn was the basis for
catechesis.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 34: "Et in Iesum Christum Filium eius vnicum,
Dominum nostrum"; 46, "Qui conceptus est de Spiritu sancto, natus ex Maria
virgine."]
The Roman Catechism explains this article by answering a classic theological
question that appeared in many other commentaries, *Cur Deus incarnatus fuerit*
(Why God became incarnate).
The catechism instructs pastors to teach the "admirable mystery of the concept"
by having "the faithful repeat by memory [...] that he [Christ] is God, who took
on human flesh, and thereby was truly 'made man'---which cannot be grasped by
our mind, nor explained through words: that he should wish to become a human,
to the end that we humans should be reborn as children of God."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 50: "Hæc sunt quæ de admirabili conceptionis
mysterio explicanda visa sunt, ex quibus, vt salutaris fructus ad nos redundare
possit, illa in primis fideles memoria repetere, ac sæpiùs cogitare cum animis
suis debent, Deum esse, qui humanam carnem assumpsit: ea verò ratione hominem

denique finem hominem fieri voluisse, vt nos homines filij Dei renasceremur.
Hæc cùm attentè considerauerint, tum verò omnia mysteria, quæ hoc articulo
continentur, humili ac fideli animo credant, & adorent: nec curiosè & quod sine
periculo vix vnquam fieri potest, illa inuestigare, ac perscrutari velint."]

This frequently quoted passage summarizes the basic theology of exchange between
God and Man by means of Christ's Incarnation.
Padilla's villancico text puts this in musical terms, speaking of Christ as
"forming the consonances of Man and God" and concluding that "Everything in God
is to descend, and everything in Man is to ascend."
The musical setting even performs the concept through literal voice exchanges
between the ascending and descending motives.

The exegete Cornelius à Lapide summarizes the same concept, drawing on Biblical
and patristic sources, to show that Christ's birth is integral to the Christian
gospel of salvation through Christ's sacrifical death and resurrection
In the birth of Christ, he writes "the Word was made flesh, God was made man,
the Son of God was made the son of a Virgin": 

> This was of all God's works the greatest and best, such that it stupefied and
> stupefies the angels and all the saints.
> In this God demonstrated his full power by uniting man to God, the mire to the
> Word, the earth to heaven; and showed his full wisdom, since the one who could
> not suffer and redeem us in his divinity, put on flesh in the Virgin, since in
> flesh he could suffer and make satisfaction for our sins to God the Father;
> and his full justice, so that by the dignity of his person, as one equal to
> God, he satisfied God's wrath and vengeance by dying on the cross; and all his
> goodness, which he poured out completely in order to give away his gifts to
> us; "For he was made the son of men, so that he might make us sons of God,"
> says St. Augustine. "He was born on the earth, so that man might be reborn
> into heaven," as St. Gregory says.
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 50, on Mt. 1:16, *natus est Jesus*: 
"q. d. Verbum caro factum est, Deus factus est homo, Filius Dei factus est
Filius Virginis.
Hoc, [...] fuit omnium Dei operum summum et maximum, ideoque illud stupuerunt et
stupent Angeli, Sanctique omnes.
In eo enim Deus ostendit summam potentiam uniendo hominem Deo, limum Verbo,
terram cœlo: ac summam sapientiam, ut qui divinitate pati et nos redimere non
poterat, carnem in Virgine indueret, qua pati, et pro peccatis nostris Deo Patri
satisfacere posset: summam quoque justititiam, quia ob dignitatem personæ, ex
æquo quasi Dei iræ et vindictæ moriendo in cruce satisfecit: summam etiam
bonitatem, quia semetipsum exinanivit, ut nos suis donis repleret: *Ac factus
est filius hominis, ut nos efficeret filios Dei*, ait S. August. *Natus est in
terra, ut homo nasceretur in cœlo*, ut ait S. Gregorius."]

These formulations not only explain God's action in becoming Incarnate for human
salvation, but also model how the faithful should respond---worshiping and
serving Christ with wonder and admiration, like the shepherds of Bethlehem.
While the Incarnation was certainly a dogma, a "rule of belief," even the
offical catechism moves beyond simply defining a theological concept, to include
an affective, devotional emphasis---a "rule of prayer" as well.[^lex-orandi]
The proper response to meditating on this "all of these mysteries," the
catechism says, would be "that with a humble and faithful spirit they should
believe, and adore."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 50: "Hæc cùm attentè considerauerint, tum verò omnia
mysteria, quæ hoc articulo continentur, humili ac fideli animo credant, &
adorent: nec curiosè & quod sine periculo vix vnquam fieri potest, illa
inuestigare, ac perscrutari velint."]

[^lex-orandi]:
The idea of a "rule of prayer" comes from a Latin motto, drawn from Prosper of
Aquitaine, that has become a standby in modern liturgical studies, *lex orandi,
lex credendi*.
Rather than use the motto to create a dichotomy between belief and prayer---in
which "the rule of prayer establishes the rule of faith", as in
@Kavanagh:LiturgicalTheology---the intent here is simply to emphasize that both
faith and worship may be seen as integral and interrelated parts of religious
life in Christianity.
For critical discussion of the motto, with attentions to its actual origin and
its changing meaning in recent scholarship, see @Irwin:LexOrandi.
<!--- ***** -->

Wonder at Christ's birth is one of the primary tropes of Christmas, and
much Spanish devotional music seems designed primarily to cultivate this
attitude.
Padilla's setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* evokes wonder not only in the
words in the virtuoso composition and performance of the music as well.
The song that is the Christ-child is "as much to hear as to admire," the
villancico says.
The villancico aims less to instruct than to amaze, just as Mary Malcolm Gaylord
has said that the goal of elaborate Spanish poetry is "to produce effects of
astonishment and awe conveyed by the Latin term *admiratio*"---and indeed
Padilla's piece asks listeners to imagine a song that is "as much to hear as to
admire [*admirar*],/ as much to admire as to hear."
[@Gaylord:Poetry, 227]

<!--- admirabile sacramentum; tan de admirar; Gaylord on admiratio diss l. 1510

 - liturgy, Leo
 - Fray Luis
-->

In this case the term *admirar* has a more specific association, with the
liturgy of Matins.
Based on the piece's position in the musical manuscripts, it was most likely sung as the fourth villancico in the Matins cycle on Christmas Eve 1657
at Puebla Cathedral.
Padilla's *Voces*, according to a 1633 decree of the cathedral chapter, would have occupied the same liturgical time and space as the fourth Responsory, *O magnum mysterium et admirabile sacramentum*:

> *Respond.* O great mystery and admirable sacrament, that the animals should
> see the newborn Lord, lying in the manger.
> Blessed Virgin, whose womb was worthy to bear the Lord Christ.  
> *Versicle.* Greetings, Mary, full of grace: The Lord is with you.
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, 175: 
"*Respond.* O magnum mysterium, & admirabile sacramentum, vt animalia vidêrent
Dominum natum, iacentem in praesepio: \* Beata Virgo, cuius viscera meruêrunt
portare Dominum Christum. *Versicle.* Ave Maria, gratia plena: Dominus tecum.]

The chapter mandated that while "the lessons should be sung in their entirety,"
"the *chanzoneta* shall serve for the Responsory, which shall be prayed speaking
while the singing is going on."
[MEX-Pc: AC 1633-12-30: 
"que a los maitines de nauidad deste año y de los venideros [...] se canten todas las liçiones yn totum sin dejar cossa alguna dellas y que la chansoneta sirba de Responsorio el qual se diga resado mientrass se estubiere cantando."]

This villancico stood in between the lessons of the second Nocturne, which were
taken from a Christmas sermon of Pope St. Leo the Great.
This means that after a cantor chanted the first lesson, a cleric spoke the
mandatory liturgical text of the fourth Responsory above *while* the chorus sang
this villancico.
<!--- cantor? -->
The poet and composer were evidently steeped in the theological and liturgical
traditions of the Church, and had good reason to refer to the Responsory even in
situations like this where it was not sung.
For the learned cathedral canons, rather than diminishing the importance of the
Responsory, the simultaneous performance of the Latin prayer and Spanish song may have actually deepend the hidden connections between the two.
Lay people outside the walls of the architectural choir would not probably have
heard or understood the words of the Latin liturgical text, so they would
perhaps not have missed much.

The Responsory evokes the scenario of the Nativity, with the animals gathered
around the manger, just as the villancico calls up the image of angels, beasts,
and humans joining together in song around the Christ-child.
In the quatrain (a *redondilla*) that closes the estribillo, the lines *tan de
oír y de admirar/ tan de admirar y de oír* actually seem like a reply to the
Responsory, as though to say that the mystery of the Incarnat Christ certainly
was an "admirable" sacrament---that is, one that can be seen---but it is also an
audible sacrament.
Listeners in Puebla could not visit the manger in Bethlehem; they could only look
at the retable paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Visitation of
the Kings and imagine.
<!--- chrysostom quote -->
But in the conception of this villancico, they could hear the "voices of the
chapel choir" reverberating in the space and through those voices they could
"hear the voice of the Father/ in tones of weeping"---that is, they could hear
the Christ the Word himself not merely speaking, but singing, through all the
other voices from the choirboys up to the angels.

More important than these angelic voices to Fray Luis, however, is the voice of
the newborn Christ himself.
Fray Luis begins the sermon by directing his listeners' attention to the
Christ-child, "weeping and trembling with cold in the stable."
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 9]
Fray Luis follows the exegetical tradition of reading Wisdom 7 as a Messianic
prophecy, such that King Solomon's words about himself may be applied to his
royal descendent, Christ: "I too am a mortal man like others, [...] and the
first sound [*voz*] that I m ade was crying like other children, because not one
of the kings had any different origin in their birth."
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 9]

Fray Luis, as an avid student and teacher of Catholic Humanism, presents Christ
as an orator and philosophical teacher, a "Master of Heaven"---*Maestro del
cielo*, the same term used for a musical master.[^Clement-magister]
He explicitly compares the voice of this incarnate Word with music:

> Oh fortunate house!
> Oh stable, more precious than all the royal palaces, where God sat upon the
> chair [*cátedra*] of the philosophy of heaven, where the word of God, though
> made mute, speaks so much more clearly, all the more silently it admonishes
> us!
> Look, then, brother, if you wish to be a true philosopher, do not remove
> yourself from this stable where the word of God cries while keeping silent;
> but this cry is greater eloquence than that of Tully [Cicero], and even than
> the music of the angels of heaven.
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 16:
<!--- first portion ... -->
"donde la palabra de Dios enmudecida, tanto mas claramente hable, cuanto mas
calladamente nos avisa.
Mira, pues, hermano, si quieres ser verdadero filósofo no te apartes deste
establo donde la palabra de Dios callando llora; mas este lloro es mayor
elocuencia que la de Tulio, y aun que las músicas de los ángeles del cielo."]

[^Clement-magister:]
This trope extends as far back as Clement of Alexandria in the first century,
whom Lapide quotes as saying that "the Word, which was with God, appears as a
teacher; the Word by which all things were build [...], as a craftsman; to teach
good living, as a master teacher."
*Exhortatione ad Gentes*, as quoted in @Lapide:Gospels19C, 878, on John 1:
"Verbum, ait, "quod erat apud Deum, doctor apparuit; Verbum per quot omnia sunt
fabricata, et quod cum eo, qui finxit, vitam simul præbuit, ut opifex, bene
vivere docuit, cum apparuisset ut magister, ut postea semper vivere suppeditaret
ut Deus."

For this passage Fray Luis cites "a doctor", and in fact the whole passage is a
paraphrase from St. Bernard of Clairvaux.

The Latin key term behind the friar's phrase *la palabra de Dios enmudecida* is,
in Bernard's fifth Christmas sermon, *Verbum infans*---the Word who is both
"infant" and "unspeaking," since like the Spanish *infante* in Padilla's
villancico, the Latin word *infans* can have either meaning.
Bernard expresses the trope in this way:

> But what kind of mediator is this, you ask, who is born in a stable, placed in
> a manger, wrapped in cloths like all others, cries like all others, in sum,
> who lies unspeaking as an infant [*infans*], just as others are accustomed to
> do?
> A great mediator he is indeed, even in this seeking all the things that are
> for peace, not just going through the motions but working effectively.
> He is an infant, but he is the infant Word [*Verbum infans*], and not even in
> his infancy does he keep silent.
[@Bernard:Nativitate, 128A, Sermo V: 
"Sed qualis mediator est, inquies, qui in stabulo nascitur, in praesepio
ponitur, pannis involvitur sicut caeteri, plorat ut caeteri, denique infans
jacet, ut caeteri consueverunt? 
Magnus plane mediator est, etiam in his omnibus, quae ad pacem sunt, non
perfunctorie, sed efficaciter quaerens.
Infans quidem est, sed Verbum infans, cujus ne ipsa quidem infantia tacet."]

Bernard is himself drawing on an older tradition of the theology of the Word
going back to St. Augustine, who reiterates this trope throughout his dozens of
Christmas sermons.
Augustine's editors even title one sermon *Verbum infans doctor humilitatis*---the
infant Word, teacher of humility.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1004, heading for sermon 187.]
<!--- him or his editor? which editor? -->
In another, Augustine preaches, 

> [This day] is called the Nativity of the Lord, when the Wisdom of God
> manifested itself unspeaking [or, as an infant], and the Word of God without
> words sent forth a voice of flesh.
> That divinity which was thus hidden, was both signified to the Magi by the
> witness of Heaven, and announced to the shepherds by an angelic voice.
> This, therefore, is the day whose anniversary we celebrate in our ritual.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 997, Sermo 185, In Natali Domini 2: 
"Natalis Domini dicitur, quando Dei Sapientia se demonstravit infantem, et Dei
Verbum sine verbis vocem carnis emisit.
Illa tamen occulta divinitas, et Magis coelo teste significate, et pastoribus
angelica voce nuntiata est.
Hanc igitur anniversaria solemnitate celebramus diem [...]."]

In true Neoplatonic fashion, Augustine builds a chain of signification from the
highest level of being---the Godhead and its incarnation as the
Christ-child---to the signs that pointed to this reality in the material world;
moving from divine Wisdom to the child in whom God manifested himself.
He then moves to the worldly signs that pointed to Christ at his birth, and then
links this to the present-day ritual of the Mass of the Nativity.
As the master of a theology of communication through sign and signified (in *De
doctrina christiana*), Augustine is teaching the faithful to hear the words
proclaimed in their midst (Scripture, preaching, liturgy) as signs pointing
first to the angels' song in Bethlehem, and to hear and heed the angel's
exhortation to the shepherds to seek out the "sign" of "a child wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in a manger" (Luke 2:XXX).
The Christ child they found was at this "infant" stage of life, not a speaker of
divine words, but was the very Word himself---as Augustine says, "a voice of
flesh."

<!--- 
- more on Augustine's concept of voice, Word, signification; to get at voice as
  embodied presence, perhaps even to sacramental hearing
- link to present-day worship; match to concept of voces
- also match scenario of "unspeaking Word" holding forth in his chair of
philosophy as magister to opening image of Voces with divine chapelmaster
listening 
- link incarnation to sacrament; find him in the Eucharist as in Chrysostom
  quote
- also link encounter with Christ to devotion and life as in closing quote about
  imitating shepherd
- bring in Palafox, Pastor de nochebuena for this
