Truth for early modern Catholics was objective; but faith was subjective.
That an eternal, all-powerful, and loving God had created the world; that humans had used their free will to turn away from God and created a legacy of sin whose end was death and damnation; that the triune God had become incarnate through Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection restored humanity's relationship to God; that Christ had founded the Church as the instrument through which the Holy Spirit would bring salvation to the world, in particular through the sacraments---these truths were the foundation of Catholic belief, and their truth was absolute.
But to become part of the Church, and thus be incorporated in Christ's body, and thus join the communion of the holy in everlasting union with God---this required faith at the individual level.
Somehow a connection had to be made between the transcendent objects of faith and the experience of the individual Christian subject.
