# Listening for Unhearable Music

## Christ as Singer and Song

The majority of villancicos that take music as their central conceit are based
on themes of heavenly music.
Within the Spanish literary tradition of *conceptismo*, in which, under a
single governing conceit, a poem may be read in two or more ways simultaneously,
these metamusical pieces create a parallel discourse on music and theology by
playing on the rich symbolic heritage of musical words and concepts.
In the terms of Boethius, these pieces use *musica instrumentalis* to point
beyond themselves to higher forms of music---to the *musica humana*, the
harmony of body and soul, and of human society; *musica mundana*, the
harmony of the planetary and astral spheres; and even beyond the material world,
to the music of the *cielo Empyreo*.
In the Empyrean (English *Heaven* instead of *heavens* or sky), these
pieces evoke the song of saints and angels, and even the mysterious harmonies of
the Godhead: three persons in one Trinity, and the two natures of Christ as
man and God.

By tracing families and lineages of related villancicos on themes of heavenly
music, part II allows us to see how the
musical theology of villancicos developed over the course of the seventeenth
century, and the shifting ways that poets, composers, and listeners understood
the spiritual power of music to link hearing and faith.
The pieces interpreted in these case studies all challenge hearers to listen for
something more than human sounds; indeed, as these pieces reflect and reinforce
a Neoplatonic theology of music, they invite devotees to listen for unhearable
music, a music that defies human imagining, which creates harmony between the
human community and the divine.

Metamusical villancicos played a special role for Spanish composers as a kind of
self-imposed *oposición* or proof piece.
This type of piece offered them the opportunity to showcase their compositional
craft and theological insight.
By adapting poetry or music previously used by a teacher, predecessor, or rival,
a composer could stake out his place in a tradition that was both artistic and
theological.
On the artistic level composers developed tropes for musical
self-representation, vying with each other for the most overt, symbolically
meaningful, and moving displays of musical artifice.
As part of a theological tradition, the pieces on themes of heavenly music
manifest changing ways of thinking about the relationship between earthly music
and heavenly or divine music, in the midst of shifting early modern
understandings of the cosmos, the human body, and society.

This chapter analyzes and interprets two families of villancicos that represent
Christ as both singer and song.
The first is *Voces, las de la capilla*, set by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla
for Puebla Cathedral in 1657, which is connected to two other known settings of
similar texts.
The second is *Suspended, cielos, vuestro dulce canto*, one of the
best-attested families of villancicos, with eight documented settings of variant
poetic texts in the later seventeenth century; the one extant complete musical
setting is by Joan Cererols, probably for the Escolania of Montserrat, around
1660.
These villancicos for Christmas connect incarnation, voice, and creation, as
they invite hearers to contemplate human music-making as a reflection of
Christ's nature as the divine "Word made flesh" (Jn 1).
Both textual traditions build on a patristic trope of Christ as
*Verbum infans*---the infant, or unspeaking Word, who does not need to
speak because God is already communicating himself to humankind through the
Christ-child's incarnate body.
The villancicos set by Padilla and Cererols turn this into musical theology by
imagining the baby Jesus not speaking, but singing; and by considering Christ
himself as the song being sung.
Thus the pieces, I argue, connected faith and hearing by making Christ the Word
audible through poetic and musical structures.


### "Voices of the Chapel Choir" and the "Unspeaking Word"
(Gutiérrez de Padilla)

In the setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* by Juan Gutiérrez de
Padilla, the first of two choruses in the polychoral ensemble of Puebla
Cathedral begins with this admonition:

> Voices of the chapel choir,\
> keep count with what is sung,\
> for the King is a musician,\
> and takes note of even the most venial dissonances,\
> after the manner of David the monarch,\
> just as in the manner of Jesus the infant prince.

As the voices declaim these words together like a solemn choral recitative,
breaking the chordal texture only for a mild dissonant suspension on the words
"light dissonances," the other chorus is literally counting
twenty-seven measures of rests until their entrance.

Thus begins a tour-de-force of music about music, in which the composer and his
ensemble take a verbal discourse about music and turn it into a musical
discourse about music.
Moreover, even as this discourse is referring through music to the music that is
currently being performed and heard, this discourse is not only about sounding
music or *musica instrumentalis*.

When the first chorus refers to "what is sung," they are not merely
referring to this literal level of human performance.
Instead, they point to *Jesús infante*---the child who is both
the *infante* or heir of the musician-king David and who is also God made
flesh as an infant, a child too young to be able to speak.

#### Christ as Music in the Poem

Any consideration of this complex piece should begin with a careful reading of
the poetic text and listening to the musical setting (even better, singing or
playing it).
[@Cashner:WLSCM32, **XXX**]
It will probably be readily apparent that this is a different type of
villancico entirely from the comic villancicos more commonly heard in recent
performances and recordings.
The poem, whose author is unknown, is so elaborately contrived that it may seem
completely unintelligible at the first encounter.
There is, indeed, no simple way to approach the text: anywhere one starts one
immediately becomes tangled in a thicket of ambiguous references and cryptic
phrases, and it is not possible to understand the text fully without reading it
as the distillation of tropes and doctrines developed through centuries of
theological literature and liturgy.
The piece demands a high level of intellectual engagement to tease out the
intricate conceit, and may thus be compared with what Bernardo Illari describes
as "enigma" villancicos.
[@Illari:Polychoral, vol. 2, 304--308]

Part of its difficulty comes from the widespread influence of the poetry of Luis
de Góngora, who played a similar role for Spanish literature on both sides of
the Atlantic to that of Giambattista Marino in Italian letters, as the
originator of a new aesthetic (referred to as *barroco* by Spanish literary
scholars) that emphasized learned artifice and highly wraught dramatic effects.
^[ as opposed to ... ]
Gongoresque poets like the author of *Voces* reveled in arcane plays
on words, contorted Latinate syntax, and multiple levels of meanings.
[@Gaylord:Poetry, 222--236; @Tenorio:Gongorismo; @Valbuena:Literatura, vol. 1,
1014--1061]

To begin simply, though, this poem represents the tradition of Spanish
*conceptismo*, in which the poet creates a sustained analogy between at
least two different things such that the understanding of each one informs the
other.
Here the two elements are music---specifically choral singing---and the
Incarnate Christ at his birth.

This may be easiest to see in the coplas.
One can read these two strophes solely on the one plane referring to Christ's
Incarnation and Passion, however elliptically.
My published translation attempts to convey some of the ambiguity of the
original; emphasizing one side of the conceit or other would lead to different
translations, of course.
In the first copla, the Christ-child gave a "wandering song" to the
Man---referring to the first man, Adam, being cast out of Paradise.
Christ "went up so high" in "sustained tones of
weeping"---suffering on the cross for human redemption.
Christ "arose on the eighth" day---a traditional way of referring to the
Sunday on the Resurrection---"in the triune."
[See the entries for the numbers eight and three in @Bongo:NumerorumMysteria and
@Ricciardo:CommentariaSymbolica.]

Reading this copla according to the other side of the conceit, the Christ-child
gave the *tonus peregrinus* chant formula to the Man, and, as a virtuoso
singer, "he went up so high" that "in a cry of sharps," he
"went up the octave in a trill."
The poet has selected musical terms with double meanings that allow listeners
with musical knowledge to think about theological concepts in a new way, and
vice versa.
For example, the sharp sign (*sustenido*) is used (as J. S. Bach would
later use it) as an icon of the cross; and musically also seems to suggest the
"strange" (another meaning of *peregrino*) quality of this song
of suffering.

The two words *peregrino tono* would have called up for educated
listeners a long tradition of using the chant *tonus peregrinus* to
symbolize the expectant wandering of sinful humanity waiting for the coming of
Christ, as Craig Wright has traced in medieval sources.
In an allegorical commentary on the liturgy, which was disseminated in
manuscript and print versions across the Hispanic world---including copies in
Puebla---Guillelmus Durandus called the whole time from the fall of Adam to the
birth of Christ, including the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness and
Babylonian captivity, the *tempus peregrinationis*.
[@Wright:Maze, 234]

An interpreter contemporary to Padilla, Cornelius à Lapide, extends the
"pilgrim" concept to the New Adam, Christ.
In a commentary also available in Puebla and throughout the Spanish Empire that
Christ, as the New Adam, was born like a "pilgrim" on a journey in a
borrowed stable.
Explaining the Greek word *eskēnosen* in John 1:14,
Lapide says "he set up a tent or tabernacle in us, that is, among us, for
a short time, like a guest or pilgrim [*peregrinus*] in a foreign land." 
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 884:
"Hoc est tentorium vel tabernaculum fixit in nobis, id est, inter nos, ad
modicum tempus, quasi hospes et peregrinus in terra aliena: erat enim ipse
civis, incola et dominus cœli ac paradisi \[...\]."]
This should teach us, he writes, to be pilgrims [*peregrinos*] on earth, though
actually citizens of heaven."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 669, on Luke 2:5: 
"ut doceret nos in terra esse peregrinos, cives vero cœli, ut ab hoc exilio
magnis virtutum passibus tendamis in cœlum, ceu patriam et civitatem nostram."]
A contemporary musician, the composer and theorist Andrés Lorente, took up the
"pilgrim song" trope, drawing on Vulgate Psalm 118:54, when he exhorted the
aspiring musician to match the music of his compositions with "the
spiritual Music of his person, cleansing his conscience, and rejoicing his soul
with Divine Music, so that he may say with David, *Cantabiles mihi erant
iustificationes tuæ in loco peregrinationis meæ* (Your right precepts have served
as songs for me in the place of my wanderings)."
[@Lorente:Porque, 609:
"la Musica espiritual de su persona, limpiando su conciencia, y alegrando su
Anima con Musica diuina, para que pueda dezir con Dauid, *Cantabiles mihi*
\[...\]."]
Within this tradition, then, the villancico uses a chant tone to present
Christ himself as the song given to sinful Man in his pilgrimage. 
It is no surprise that in the musical setting, Padilla quotes the chant formula
literally, so that the symbol is present to the ear both in word and tone.

This rich interplay between the musical and theological sides of the
conceit extends throughout the whole villancico, opening up so many possible
points of reference and interpretations that it will not be possible here to go
through them all in detail, as I have done elsewhere.
[@Cashner:PhD, 133--203]
Instead it may be most helpful to give a brief summary of the poem's
representation of Christ as both singer and song.

The central conceit of the poem is to link the "voices of the chapel
choir"---the actual sounding music being heard in the performance of the
villancico---with a higher, theological Music with a capital M, namely, the
Christ-child himself.
The poem evokes the musical voices of human singers, angelic choirs, ancient
prophets, and even the crying voice of the newborn Christ.
The second copla encapsulates the whole conceit: Christ is a divine musical
"composition," in which the divine chapelmaster "proves"
his mastery at creating "consonances of a Man and God."[^estribillo-vs-emblems]

[^estribillo-vs-emblems]:
This is a common practice in villancicos: a puzzling idea presented at the
beginning of the piece is not fully explained until the end of the coplas,
so that when the estribillo is then repeated, the listener can hear it with
new understanding.
^[ formal relationships here, diss p. 145 **XXX** ]
In many villancico poems, the relationship of estribillo and coplas is
similar to that between the image and accompanying texts in contemporary
emblem books (@Covarrubias:Emblemas).
In the emblem book of Covarrubias, the emblem is often striking but cryptic,
juxtaposing (for example) two well-known symbols in an unusual way, often
with a Latin motto.
On the facing page is a poem that expands on the ideas in the image, and on
the reverse of that page is a prose explanation of both the poem and the
image.
In this villancico text, then, the estribillo's function is similar to the
purpose of the emblem and poem as presenting attention-getting but enigmatic
symbols, while the coplas share the more explanatory function of the emblem
book's prose.
Just as one would read the explanation and then turn back to consider the
emblem again, now with a heightened sense of meaning, so too in the
villancico, when the estribillo is repeated after the coplas, listeners have
the opportunity to reconsider what they have heard in light of the coplas.


The "chapel," it would seem, is performing before the king, like the
Spanish *Capilla Real*; and this King, that is, God, "is a
musician."
His only-begotten son---his royal *infante*---is this divine
chapelmaster's *oposición* or proof piece, in which he demonstrates his
mastery by creating concord between opposed elements.
Christ brings together infinite and finite ("maxima and breve"), and
creates a consonance to restore the discordant relationship between sinful Man
and the holy God by reconciling both in his own body.

On the theological side of the conceit, who exactly is this king who is
listening so carefully to the chapel choir's voices?
The poet explicitly connects the king to "David the monarch," the paragon
of Biblical musicians as both the traditional author of the psalms and as the
founder of the first musical ensemble for worship in the ancient Hebrew
temple.
^[ source ]
Calling Jesus *infante* identifies this child as David's
heir---that is, as the Messiah; and the phrase *a lo de* (in the manner or
style of) suggests that this child will be no less exacting a musical taskmaster
than his ancestor.
There is also a deeper meaning to the term *infante* here, to which we will
return.

As the poem continues, it presents Christ as the theological fulfillment of the
prophecies made to and through David, especially the psalms; in musical terms,
Christ's life "is putting notes to his lyrics" (ll. 8--9), and thus
his life is recounted cryptically with the technical vocabulary for describing a
musical composition or performance.
Theologically, God had promised to David an heir to sit on his throne forever
and deliver his people,
and through Isaiah the prophet he renewed this promise by saying that a child
would be born upon whose shoulder would rest divine, eternal
authority.
^[ cite Is. 22:22 but note context ]
As Biblical interpreters of the time all agreed, the complete fulfillment of
these prophecies, the culmination of all God's "centuries of heroic
exploits" (l. 8) came not at Christ's birth, but at his death and
resurrection, traditionally thirty-three years (and three months and three days)
later.
^[ mention ``A que el juego'' ]
In musical terms, the words of David and the prophets are just the lyrics;
Christ's life is the song.
The key of authority---*clave*---is the same word for clef; and it
awaits "the thirty-three," suggesting some kind of musical measure.

The second section of the introduction (ll. 11--16) depicts the moment of
Christ's birth as a musical performance.
This happens "years before the sign, 'dexterity in hope'."
Since the poet has just referred to "the thirty-three" as a metonym for
Christ's passion, the *divisa*---a sign of any kind but particularly a
heraldic emblem or motto---may refer to the cross.
^[ source ]
 others who say the same
The motto, *la destreza en la esperanza*, sounds like a gloss a phrase
from the Roman historian Tacitus, *spes in virtute*, which was cried in
the midst of a famous battle.
^[**XXX**  source, details ]
The heraldic and chivalric imagery and language (*hazañas*,
*destreza*) here continues the notion of Christ as a
David-like hero; but in the musical context it also established Christ as a
musical virtuoso.
The term *destreza* was commonly used in Spanish musical writing to
denote virtousity and consummate craftsmanship; it could be used both for
players and for composers.
^[**XXX**  source ]

In the next lines we begin to hear this musician's song, and the theological and
musical come too close to cleanly separate.
The solmization syllables *sol* and *mi* here indicate musical
pitches, as well as the symbolic puns on "sun" and "me."
The "Gloria" of the angelic choirs begins "on *sol*," as many
Gregorian *Gloria in excelsis* chants do; it also begins "with the
sun," a reference both to Christ's birth traditionally at midnight ("at
the half-measure of night", l. 15) and a symbol of his royalty, the same
symbol used by Spain's own king, Philip IV.
^[**XXX**  cite also Is. 60:1, connect Jn 1:14, Tit 2:11 ]
The reference to "glory" and "grace" here is part of a long
theological tradition which we will explore later.

^[**XXX**  or here ]

Now the poet turns even more strongly from using music as a metaphor to
describing actual music-making, as in the estribillo the text calls to mind the
whole creation of humans, animals (*hombres y brutos*, l. 20; also
the reference to birdsong in l. 16),
heavenly spheres (*las distancias*, a technical term in both astronomy
and music), all joining with the angels in the chorus to praise God made
Incarnate in their midst.
Like all poetry about music, this representation of music draws on the poet's
experience of actual, contemporary music---thus the spheres sing "in one
choir and the other," like Spain's polychoral ensembles.
The scene recalls many contemporary images of the Adoration of the Sheperds, in
particular one by Francisco de Zurbarán painted in Cádiz only a few years after
Padilla left it for the New World, and an engraving in a 1617 breviary
that both poet and composer are likely to have seen.
^[**XXX**  sources and dates ]

The phrase *grave, suave y sonoro* seems to have been a stock
description of sacred music appropriate for liturgical worship.
The same words are used to describe the music of Christ as a musician (in fact,
as a musical instrument) in José de Cáseda's *Qué música divina* from
a half-century later, as discussed in a later chapter.
A bequest to Mexico City Cathedral in **XXX** used nearly identical
terms to describe the Latin Responsories that should be sung.
Interestingly, in that case the term was used to specify Latin-texted music
*as opposed to* villancicos.
^[**XXX**  cite Goldman, check detail ]
Here, within a villancico, the term is used to refer to a higher form of
music-making, within the Neoplatonic tradition of using that which is lowly to
point toward higher truths.
We will see that Padilla uses stylistic topics to match the reference to
different types of music within the same piece.

The numbers here ("three by three, two by two, one by one") have a wide
range of possible symbolic meanings, while at the most literal level (the level
Padilla seizes on in his setting) it describes the number of voices in the
musical texture.
"Two by two" would seem to be a reference to the animals on Noah's Ark,
here referring not only to the animals in the stable, but also to the whole
scene as a picture of the Christian church, a symbolic connection going back to
the first century.
^[**XXX**  cite 1 Peter, Augustine ]
"Three by three" could be the nine ranks of angelic choirs, and
"one by one" could refer to humans or to Christ himself (particularly his
union of divine and human in a single body).
^[**XXX**  ? cite 9-fold angel choir ]

Thus far the poet has taken us from listening to the chapel choir singing in the
present, to the ancient temple choir of David and the voices of prophets through
the centuries, and up to the moment when the angels led the song of Gloria at
Christ's birth.
But all these voices, the poem now says, have been "awaiting the
opportune time, the one who was before all time" (ll. 24--25).
Once again, the true music of Christmas is Christ himself, and thus the next
lines represent the voice of the baby Jesus.
The musical imagery here continues the conceit of the King as musician, a
*padre* (father, priest) like most Spanish chapelmasters including Padilla,
who either sounds the pitch *A (la, mi, re)* in Guidonian solmization with
his voice as a tuning note (the same one used today), or sings an intonation on
that note as a cantor would do.
Another translation of the contorted syntax here might suggest that the poetic
speaker actually "heard the voice of the Father singing," that is,
*through* the voice of the child.
At this cue, the speaker says, he heard singing, not in *puntos de canto
llano* (plainchant) but *puntos de llanto* (weeping); this connects
Christ's cries at his birth with those at his death.
^[**XXX**  cite ]
The song is "as much to be seen (or admired) as to be
heard"---because the song and the singer are one and the same.

This interpretation depends on reading "the sign of *A (la, mi,
re)*" as a symbol of Christ himself.
The poem says the voices were all awaiting "the one who was
before all time," an appositive phrase referring to Christ, whom the Nicene
Creeds declares was "begotten of the father before all ages
[*secula*].
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 42: "ex patre natum ante omnia secula."]
The reference to Christ's eternal existence together with the letter A recalls
Christ's description of himself in the Revelation to John as
"*alpha* and *omega*"---the Vulgate simply puts the Greek
letter A here.[^alpha-omega]
This title indicates that Christ is "the beginning and the end,"
"the one who is and who was and who is to come" (Rev. 1:8,
21:6, 22:13).[^Rev1-8]
The time symbolism works on a musical level as well, but the "sign of A"
also suggests the musical pitch A.

[^alpha-omega]:
This is an especially interesting choice since the Greek text of
Rev. 1:8, actually spells out *alpha* (but not *omega*).

[^Rev1-8]:
In both Greek and Latin, the phrase in Revelation 1:8 repeats exactly
the words used for the name of God (the Hebrew tetragrammaton, *YHWH*) in
the translations of Ex. 3:14 into those languages (Greek
*hō ōn*, Latin *qui est*).

The final couplet epitomizes the theology of Incarnation through a play on
rising and falling musical lines: "Everything in Man is to ascend/ and
everything in God is to descend" (ll. 32--33).
Most discussions of the Incarnation in contemporary theological literature cited
some version of the maxim attributed to St. Ambrose, "God became Man
so that Man might become Divine."
^[**XXX**  check source, cite ]
In Christ, God humbled himself so that he might raise up sinful humans to share
in his glory (Philippians **XXX**).
This central theology of Christianity is represented in the poem through the
musical concept of a contrapuntal voice exchange.

The villancico began by drawing listeners' attention to the voices of Christmas,
and exhorting the singing voices of the chapel choir to take note of their own
singing while also listening for "what is sung" on a higher level.
The piece connects Christ and David as musician-kings, with Christ as the song
that puts the prophetic "lyrics" of David and other Scriptural authors to
music.
After long waiting, at the "opportune time," Christ was born into the
world to begin a battle "in hope," a virtuoso performance fulfilled in
his death and resurrection at "the thirty-three," upon the "sign"
of the cross.
Christ himself is the incranate Word, and his infant cries are the true
"sign of A," the "song" that sets the tone for all the other
voices, "in one choir and another" of the Christmas manger, and at the
Christmas liturgy in the present-day of the villancico's performance.

#### Music about Music in the Voices of Puebla's Chapel Choir

How, then, does the composer turn the musical-theological conceits of this poem
into actual *musica instrumentalis*?

In any example of sung poetry, we may distinguish three aspects of text setting:
text projection, depiction, and expression.
^[**XXX**  cite Burkholder for the latter two ]
In text projection, a composer projects the words clearly according to their
prosody and grammatical structure, and sets them to memorable melodic and
rhythmic patterns, so that listeners can hear and understand the words of the
poem.
In text depiction, a composer uses musical techniques (in this period, often
musical-rhetorical figures) to paint or represent the meaning of the text in a
symbolic way, such as in madrigalisms.
Text expression encompasses a variety of ways that a composer can communicate
the feeling, mood, and meaning of the text to listeners, including the use of
affective or other stylistic topics or anything that makes the listener feel and
experience the meaning of the text.

Padilla's setting of this poem is a tour-de-force of text depiction, but it
also demonstrates careful attention to text projection.
This approach fits with an aesthetic of Tridentine clarity in presenting the
text, as well as with traditions from Spanish popular and theatrical traditions
of singing poetry, especially traditions of adapting stock melodic formulas for
singing *romance* poetry.
^[**XXX**  cite ]

##### Text Projection

The formal structure of the musical setting is closely linked to that of the
poem.
[@Cashner:WLSCM32, **XXX**]
The poem begins with an introductory section, which will be useful to label
*introducción* as many poetry imprints of other villancicos do.
The *introducción* consists of two six-line strophes, each followed by the
same *respuesta* or response of a four-line strophe.
The placement of rests and repeat markings in the performing parts makes clear
that the *respuesta* is sung after each of the six-line
strophes.
^[**XXX**  distinguish from other edition, performance ]
The whole *introducción* is in the poetic meter of *romance* in
*-a -a*: this means that every line is eight syllables long, and that there
is assonance in the last two vowels of the even-numbered lines.
^[**XXX**  cite metrica ]
Thus the poem uses *-a -a* assonance in *canta*,
*disonancias*, *monarca*, and so on.

Another way to think of *romance* poetry is more similar to traditional
poetic forms in other languages, such as Old English and Germanic poetry---as
sixteen-syllable lines, with a *caesura* in the middle and assonance at the
end.
^[**XXX**  cite crestomatia, romance publications, Old English, German exx ]
In other words, the beginning of this villancico would probably have been
arranged like this (partly because of narrow columns in the typographical
layout):

> Voces, las de la capilla,\
> cuenta con lo que se canta,\
> que es músico el rey, y nota\
> las más breves disonancias\
> a lo de Jesús infante\
> y a lo de David monarca.

But it could also be arranged like this:

-------------------------       ----------------------------
Voces, las de la capilla,       cuenta con lo que se canta,
que es músico el rey, y nota    las más breves disonancias
a lo de Jesús infante           y a lo de David monarca.
--------------------------      ----------------------------

Padilla sets the text as though it were arranged in the latter way: he pauses
briefly where the *caesurae* would be, but punctuates the assonant lines
with clear points of harmonic arrival.
He articulates the end of the strophes in the *introducción* with full
cadences.

Padilla begins the piece with the voices of the first choir moving together
rhythmically to declaim the words in something like choral recitative.
Padilla arranges the phrases so that the singers present the lines in pairs,
with emphasis on the assonant even-numbered lines.
The composer has paid close attention to details of accentuation and diction.
He sets the first two lines of poetry (mm. 1--10) with relatively long
note values on the stressed syllables, creating a deliberate, careful tone that
embodies the poetic exhortation to "pay attention" to what is sung.

He has the chorus sing the first word, *Voces*, beginning
on the second subdivision of the ternary measure, with three minims for the
first syllable and two for the second.
Since the word ends on S and is an invocation, it would make sense to have the
singers make a small break between mm. 2--3, placing the S sound on the
last minim of m. 2 or just after.
This allows the word to be sung in a way that matches the natural quantities of
its two syllables and that projects its grammatical structure in the opening
sentence of the poem.
That first word, in a common device of Padilla's villancicos, is sung on the
second minim of the measure: thus the leader could conduct the downbeat, cuing
the singers to breathe, and then the chorus would sing their entrance, which
because of its high tessitura and irregular, offbeat rhythms, seems to hang
mysteriously in the air.
The word *cuenta* (m. 6) is also sung on the second minim of the
measure and is then held for three minims, syncopated across the downbeat.
After this long not, like pulling back a spring, the metrical pattern is
released and the voices flow in even, regularly accented minims on *con
lo que se canta*.
For the next phrase (*que es músico el rey*) Padilla creates the effect
of an interjection, breaking the rhythmic pattern and beginning this phrase,
like the others, on the second minim of the measure.

The rest of Padilla's setting is as meticulously crafted as this opening phrase
on the level of text projection.
Another example is the interjection *¡O qué canto!*, which Padilla
starts on the last minim of the measure before the previous phrase has finished,
exactly as an interjection should.

His setting of the estribillo is more madrigalistic---that is, more driven by
text depiction---but still closely follows the natural accentuation patterns of
the poetry.
Aside from the symbolic meanings of the two changes of meter (m. 45 and
m. 60; see below), these shifts match the stress patterns implicit in
these sections of poetry.

At a larger scale, the piece's harmonic structure coordinates with the form of
the poem.
The piece is in mode I, in *cantus mollis*---that is, the one flat in the
key signature transposes the mode up a fourth; the final is on G and the Tenor
parts have a mostly authentic ambitus.
The internal cadences in the *introducción* are on G (m. 19), D
(m. 27), and G (m. 44); and the cadences at the end of the
estribillo and of both coplas are also on G.
These cadence points are in line with the prescriptions of contemporary
theorists for modal counterpoint, while also punctuating the
sections of the poem and making its grammatical and rhetorical structure clear
to listeners.
^[**XXX**  cte diss. 164 Cerone, Judd, Barnett ]

##### Text Depiction

It is on the level of text depiction---representing the meaning of the text
through musical figures and symbols---that Padilla demonstrates his full mastery
of his craft by presenting an intricate discourse about music through music
itself.
As we have noted, the opening invocation to the "Voices of the chapel
choir, keep count with what is sung" is voiced by one division of the polychoral
ensemble while the other chorus literally counts its rests until its entrance in
the *respuesta*.
The first chorus sings the word *cuenta* on a long, offbeat note, a
blackened, dotted semibreve (that is, artificially perfected) that leaps off the
page as a visual indication to the singer to "keep count," and makes a
clear audible symbol as well.
Padilla sets "the lightest dissonance" in mm. 14--19 by having the
Altus I suspend across the first minim of m. 18, making a dissonant
seventh against the Tenor's A---this forms a light dissonance that quickly
resolves to F sharp and then to a cadence on G in m. 19.
On the repeat of this section, it is easy to imagine that an experienced trble
singing about "the trills of the dawn" in mm. 25--27 would have
improvised a trill on the suspension at this cadence.
[See Cerone's isntructions for improvisng ornaments at cadences,
@Cerone:Melopeo, 545--546.]
In the *respuesta*, where Chorus II sings about awaiting "the
thirty-three," Padilla writes precisely thirty-three pitches for both of the
sung vocal parts.

Where the poem says that the whole world was "waiting" for "the
sign"---that is, the Incarnate Christ---in Padilla's setting, that sign comes
with the estribillo in m. 45, where the C meter sign indicates a shift
to duple meter, after which the musicians shift from the declamatory style of
the introduction to a more regular rhythmic pattern, moving together in
*corcheas* (modern eighth notes).
Here Padilla depicts what the words say by building up a point of imitation
"from one choir to the other" (mm. 45--50) and then creating
polychoral dialogue (mm. 51--59).
Padilla sets the numbers in the poem literally: three performers for
*tres a tres*, two for *dos a dos*, and one for *uno a uno*.

The style of this section, contrasting with that of the introduction, is like
that of a madrigal (Music example 8).
The madrigal *As Vesta Was from Latmos Hill Descending* by Thomas Weelkes (1601)
uses the same technique to depict similar words, possibly reflecting a common
Italian model.[^Weelkes]
This section, then, is "music about music" in yet another sense, as Padilla refers
to other genres and styles of music within one villancico.
As the poem depicts the actual singing performed at the firs Christmas, Padilla
uses a style that evokes and embodies convivial group singing.
The angels, planets, shepherds, and animals around the créche are represented
not only as singing in the abstract---they are singing a madrigal.

[^Weelkes]:
Weelkes's madrigal was published in Thomas Morley's *The Triumphes of Oriana*
(London, 1601), but there is little evidence that English music circulated in
Spain or its colonies.

[insert float: Music example 8]

Padilla's musical scene matches contemporary Nativity images that portray
music-making around the manger.
Padilla's Andalusian compatriot Francisco de Zurbarán depicted two levels of
music in his *Adoration of the Shepherds*, painted for the high altar of the
Carthusian monastery of Jerez de la Frontera in 1638--1639
(Figure 4).
In heaven above, angels sing to the accompaniment of the harp, while below,
another angelic consort joins the company of worshippers in the stable, and they
sing to the accompaniment of the lute.
In Spain the harp was associated with both heavenly music and earthly church
music (see chapter 5), and the lute, with musical genres performed outside of
church, such as the madrigal.
Villancicos crossed both domains, and therefore could incorporate references to
both styles within them---much as Zurbarán's painting incorporates aspects of
genre painting, the representation of earthy details from everyday life, into a
representation of sacred history.
[@Sanchez:Zurbaran, 31; @Cherry:Bodegon; @Haraszti-Takacs:Genre]
Both visual and musical forms of crossover were especially fitting to represent
the Christmas moment when the "maxima" and "breve," high and low, were brought
together, and the music of the heavenly chorus broke through to be heard by
humble shepherds.
Zurbarán's image, in line with other contemporary iconography like the manger
scene in a 1613 Roman Breviary and the Adoration of the Shepherds on the retable
of Puebla Cathedral, includes a bound lamb next to the manger as a symbol of
Christ's fate as the paschal lamb, much as "the thirty-three" and other
references in this villancico connect Christ's birth to his sacrificial
death.
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, 168]
^[**XXX**  Puebla cathedral book or image in this book ]

[insert float: Figure 4]

At the phrase *y aguardan tiempo oportuno* ("and they await the opportune time,"
m. 60), Padilla shifts meter signatures again, returning to ternary meter (CZ)
with a new lilting rhythmic pattern.
This creates a sense of arrival in a new *tiempo*, which then abruptly halts at
the end of the phrase, *quien antes del tiempo fue* ("the one who was before
time", mm. 63--65).
As Christ is "the beginning and the end" (Rev. **XXX**), this halt is fitting.
Lorente says the term *tiempo* can denote the meter and the symbol that sets the
meter.[@Lorente:Porque, bk. 2, 149]
Thus, since Christ existed before all time theologically, Padilla puts this
phrase "before the time signature" musically.

The musical conceipts in the next lines of poetry shift the focus from rhythm to
melody, as the poem uses solmization symbols: *por el signo a la mi re, puestos
los ojos en mi* (upon the sign of *A (la, mi, re)*, with eyes set on
me/*mi*).
Likewise, Padilla's metamusical conceits play on the musical terms in the most
literal sense, realizing the solmization syllables in several ways at the same
time (Figure 5).
Both Altus I and Tenor I sing the word *a* on the pitch *A (la, mi, re)* (m.
67).
On the words *la mi re* (mm. 68--69), the Tiple I sings the pitches D--C♯--D: in
the soft hexachord the D would in fact be *la*; then the written sharp on C
would alter it to a *mi* in *musica ficta*; and the final D could be *re* in the
natural hexachord.
On the same words, the Tenor sings D--A--D: *la--mi* in the soft hexachord, then
*re* in the natural hexachord.
At the end of this phrase (m. 72), the performers of all three voices sing the
word *mi* by literally "putting their eyes on *mi*, with Tiple and Tenor on A
(*mi* in the soft hexachord) and Altus on E (*mi* in the natural hexachord).

[insert float: Figure 5]

Guidonian solmization was still a fundamental part of Spanish theory treatises
through the eighteenth century, and were used frequently enough that they came
to be used as the Spanish names for pitch-classes in the seven-note scale.
The prevalence of solmization practice is evidenced by both books intended for
specialists (Cerone) and those for beginners, such as the 1677 guitar primer of
Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz, as well as student notebooks in manuscript.
[@Ruiz:Luz; examples of manuscript student notebooks are in E-Bbc: M732/13--16;
see also @Cohen:NotesMiddleAges]
Even if fully trained singers did not often resort to the actual syllables in
reading music, they were trained in the system and could certainly have
recognized the Guidonian puns in this passage.

The next phrase evokes both singing and listening---*a la voz del padre oí cantar
por puntos de llanto* (I heard the father's voice singing in weeping
tones)---and on "I heard" (m. 77), all the voices cadence and then rest, as
though to stop and listen.
To create the effect of the interjection *¡O, qué canto!*, Padilla has the
second chorus enter on the last minim of the measure (m. 83), before the first
chorus has finished their phrase.
The emphatic *O* in the succeeding passage may well be intended to contrast with
the *signo A (la, mi, re)*, marking Christ as *alpha* and *omega*.

In the final couplet of the estribillo (*Todo en el hombre es subir/ y todo en
Dios es bajar*, mm. 100--126), as the full chorus evokes the theological concept
of God's descent and humankind's ascent through the Incarnation, Padilla creates
a matching musical concept of contrasting ascending and descending gestures with
opposed rhythmic profiles.
In the first gesture, for Man ascending, the voices ascend stepwise in minims,
in a lilting ternary dotted rhythm.
this is first heard in Altus I and Tenor I, mm. 98--100, with the ascent
highlighted by having the Tenor move through F sharp.
In rhetorical terms this is *anabasis*.
In the second gesture, for God descending, all the voices move
downwards---*catabasis*---in emphatic duple rhythm with blackened semibreves,
including passing through added E flats (Chorus I, mm. 100--104).
The Tenor I has the highest number of blackened notes, singing a sequence of
descending fourths (mm. 100--103), then thirds (mm. 108--112), and finally
seconds (mm. 118--122) (Figure 6).

[insert float: Figure 6]

When Padilla juxtaposes these ideas in the full polychoral texture, listeners
can hear the fusion of both rising and falling melodic lines, and two different
rhythmic systems---the duple-compound *sesquialtera* rhythm of "Man ascending"
and the triple-simple rhythm of "God descending."
In the final cadence, the Altus I combines the two gestures at once by singing
the words "everything in God is to descend" to the music associated with "Man
ascending" (mm. 124--126).
The passage embodies the central theology of the Incarnation: through God's
descent to become Man in Christ, Man may ascend to share in God's nature.
^[**XXX**  patristic sources for this ]

Each of the two poetic coplas centers on a concept from music theory: the first
plays with the notion of *peregrino tono* ("wandering song," or the plainchant
*tonus peregrinus*); the second, on the contrasting rhythmic values of *la
máxima y breve*.
True to form, Padilla sets *peregrino tono* to a fragment of the actual
plainchant tone.
The last psalm tone was known in Latin sources as the *tonus peregrinus* and in
Spanish sources as *tono irregular* or *tono mixto*.
Its final cadence is a rising minor third followed by a stepwise descent to the
final (**??**). ^[**XXX**  p. 354) ]
In *cantus durus* this is D--F--E--D; if notated in the *cantus mollis*
transposition of this villancico, the pitches would be G--B♭--A--G, which are
exactly what the Altus I sings on these words (mm. 128--129).
The same motive of the a leap up followed by a descending third is then imitated
in the Tenor I and Tiple I on F--E--D, the *durus* version.

^[**XXX**  cautionary F# as "strange tone"? ]

In the last phrase of this copla, when the poem speaks of Christ "going up the
octave" or theologically "ascending on the eighth day", Padilla creates an
octave ascent across the voices, with the Tenor leaping D~4~--G~4~ and the Tiple
continuing, G~4~--D~5~.
This octave also plays into the symbolism of the *tonus peregrinus*, since
Cerone says that Spanish writers call this "eighth" psalm tone *octavo
irregular*.[@Cerone:Melopeo, 354]

The second copla emphasizes rhythm, using the *máxima* and *breve*, in medieval
theory the longest and shortest note values, to point to the union of eternal
and temporal, infinite and finite in the incarnate Christ as the divine
chapelmaster's "composition."
Padilla presents the basic concept of long versus short note values through the
lengthened note on *máxima* in the Tenor (mm. 153--154) over a long held note
in the Bassus (mm. 154--155).
Ironically, each of these long notes is actually a breve.
How better to express the unity between these opposites than by vocalizing the name
for one while singing the value of the other?
The Altus echoes with a blackened semibreve (mm. 154--155), which in this
context is a long note made shorter, getting at the same concept a different
way.
At a more arcane level, the whole first phrase of this coplas (mm. 147--156) is
ten compases long, which is precisely equal to the length of a true maxima
(eight measures in C3) plus a breve (two measures).

Padilla's setting as a whole is intimately connected to the sound and meaning of
the poetry.
Padilla has his chapel choir present the poem in a way that allows the words to
be heard clearly, reflecting their grammatical structure and the poem's dramatic
shape, while also embodying the conceits of the poetry in appropriate musical
symbols and even adding some musical puzzles of his own.

#### Theology of Christ as *Verbum infans*

<!--

- this piece comes from a deeper background of theology of Incarnation & voice
  related to Christmas; manifests tropes of Christmas - devotion to Christ *as*
  something rather than teaching that Christ *is* something

  + Christmas preaching, exegesis
    - Verbum infans
    - (Grace & glory)
    - Alpha & O

-->

The villancico *Voces, las de la capilla* embodies the central tropes of
Christmas devotion in early modern Catholicism, while extending these traditions
by expressing them through the language and techniques of music.
In other words, the feast of Christmas centered on devotion to incarnation of
Christ as a child, the "Word made flesh"; this piece of devotional music
presents a poetic and musical discourse on Christ's incarnation by conceiving of
"the Word" in musical terms and then representing that concept in actual music.
Padilla's piece presents a new twist on a trope that extends back to Bernard of
Clairvaux and further to Augustine---that of Christ as *Verbum infans*, "the
unspeaking/infant Word."
This trope continued to be turned and refined through the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and can be found in Christmas sermons and exegetical
commentaries on the Gospel infancy narratives that were widely available in
Padilla's day and that would have been familiar to a university-educated priest.

The festival of Christmas had first developed from regionally varying annual
celebrations of Christ's birth and beginnings, and solidified as a formal
observance among the church communities of fourth-century Rome.
[@Talley:LiturgicalYear, 85--140; @Bradshaw:EarlyWorship, 86--89;
@Roll:OriginsChristmas]
The customary readings and chants from Scripture developed alongside the other
customs of Christmas throughout the medieval period.
While it may be more conventional to label these traditions "doctrines" or
"dogmas" (particularly after Trent), they represent more than officially
codified propositions.
Rather, the tropes of Christmas include not only doctrinal concepts like the two
natures of the incarnate Christ as divine and human, but extend also to
attitudes, affects, frames of mind---all the cultural practices that go into
making the festival "feel like Christmas," the "proper ways of worshipping" (one
etymology of the term *orthodoxy*) that characterize this particular
celebration.[^feasts-and-seasons]

[^feasts-and-seasons]:
@Grimes:Beginnings, 54--62, identifies distinct but interlinked ritual modes of
"liturgy" and "celebration."
Scholars of ritual studies and Christian liturgical theology have consistently
argued that liturgy does more than promulgate doctrines, but musicological and
philological studies of post-Tridentine religious arts have not always paid
enough attention to the insights of these fields.
For an influential modern Catholic theology of the function of liturgical
feasts, see @Taft:LiturgicalYear, 3--4, 12--23.

These tropes contributed to what might be called a Christmas imaginary, the
contents of which one may see restated and endlessly varied not only in
villancicos but also painted and sculpted on Spanish church walls and printed in
the text and illustrations of contemporary theological books.
The visual and performing arts preserved in such historic sources represent only
a portion of the lively variety of customary social practices connected with the
feast---gift-giving, traditional foods, popular songs from oral tradition.
both official sources like the liturgy, creeds, catechisms, commentaries, and
homilies as well as unofficial popular devotion drew from and contributed to a
commmon fund of Christmas tropes, which by the seventeenth century was filled to
overflowing.
The function of early modern Catholic feasts was not so much to teach people
that Christ *is* something, as to cultivate to devotion to Christ *as*
something.
The goal was doxology more than doctrine.

Though oral tradition was probably still the most important force in cultivating
the Christmas imaginary in early modern Spain, printed theological literature
disseminated and reinforced these tropes in Padilla's day and makes them
accessible today.
The Christmas liturgy provided the foundation for the theology behind this
trope, through the way the ritual texts framed the interpretation of
Scripture within the Church's exegetical traditions.
Certain passage of Scripture treating Christ's birth, his Messianic identity,
and the theology of incarnation became classic Christmas *loci theologici*
through the mutually reinforcing practices of, first, reading and singing these
passages in the developing Christmas liturgy, and, second, interpreting these
passages in preaching and commentaries.
[On patristic exegesis and its relationship to later interpretve traditions, see
@Kannengiesser:PatristicExegesis; @McKim:BiblicalInterpreters;
@Thompson:ReadingwDead.]

For example, the tradition of beginning the series of psalms in the Christmas
Matins liturgy with Psalm 2 was influenced by the interpretation of that psalm
as a Messianic prophecy in patristic exegesis---such as the sermons of Pope St.
Leo the Great, Pope St. Gregory the Great, and St. Ambrose, which were included
in Matins as the lessons of the second and third Nocturnes.
Moreover, the Scripture's placement in this liturgical context in turn
reinforced the Messianic interpretation.
Padilla's villancico was performed in the midst of these Scriptures and
patristic preaching, as well as contemporary preaching in the vernacular; it
should be understood as amplifying, extending, and even playing with the
Christmas tropes in those other sources.

devotion (Christ "is" and Christ "as"; God's action in Incarnation and our

-->

The foundation of the Christmas feast was devotion to "Jesus Christ, [God's]
only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin
Mary," as stated in the Apostle's Creed, which in turn was the basis for
catechesis.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 34: "Et in Iesum Christum Filium eius vnicum,
Dominum nostrum"; 
@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 46, "Qui conceptus est de Spiritu sancto, natus ex Maria
virgine."]
The Roman Catechism explains this article by answering a classic theological
question that appeared in many other commentaries, *Cur Deus incarnatus fuerit*
(Why God became incarnate).
The catechism instructs pastors to teach the "admirable mystery of the concept"
by having "the faithful repeat by memory [...] that he [Christ] is God, who took
on human flesh, and thereby was truly 'made man'---which cannot be grasped by
our mind, nor explained through words: that he should wish to become a human,
to the end that we humans should be reborn as children of God."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 50: "Hæc sunt quæ de admirabili conceptionis

continentur, humili ac fideli animo credant, & adorent: nec curiosè & quod sine
periculo vix vnquam fieri potest, illa inuestigare, ac perscrutari velint."]

The exegete Cornelius à Lapide attributes a similar formulation to Anselm,
writing that Christ "lowered himself to the earth and flesh, in order to lift us
up to heaven. 'Therefore,' says St. Anselm, 'God was made man, in order that man
might be made God.'"
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 670, on Lk. 2:7:
"Depressit se in terram et carnem, ut nos eveheret in cœlum. *Ideo*, ait S.
Anselm, *Deus factus est homo, ut homo fieret Deus*."]
Lapide draws on Biblical and patristic sources to show that Christ's birth is
integral to the Christian gospel of salvation through Christ's sacrifical death
and resurrection.
In the birth of Christ, he writes "the Word was made flesh, God was made man,
the Son of God was made the son of a Virgin":

> This was of all God's works the greatest and best, such that it stupefied and
> stupefies the angels and all the saints.
> In this God demonstrated his full power by uniting man to God, the mire to the
> Word, the earth to heaven; and showed his full wisdom, since the one who could
> not suffer and redeem us in his divinity, put on flesh in the Virgin, since in
> flesh he could suffer and make satisfaction for our sins to God the Father;
> and his full justice, so that by the dignity of his person, as one equal to
> God, he satisfied God's wrath and vengeance by dying on the cross; and all his
> goodness, which he poured out completely in order to give away his gifts to
> us; "For he was made the son of men, so that he might make us sons of God,"
> says St. Augustine. "He was born on the earth, so that man might be reborn
> into heaven," as St. Gregory says.
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 50, on Mt. 1:16, *natus est Jesus*:
"q. d. Verbum caro factum est, Deus factus est homo, Filius Dei factus est
Filius Virginis.
Hoc, \[...\] fuit omnium Dei operum summum et maximum, ideoque illud stupuerunt et

In eo enim Deus ostendit summam potentiam uniendo hominem Deo, limum Verbo,
terram cœlo: ac summam sapientiam, ut qui divinitate pati et nos redimere non
poterat, carnem in Virgine indueret, qua pati, et pro peccatis nostris Deo Patri

bonitatem, quia semetipsum exinanivit, ut nos suis donis repleret: *Ac factus
est filius hominis, ut nos efficeret filios Dei*, ait S. August. *Natus est in
terra, ut homo nasceretur in cœlo*, ut ait S. Gregorius."]

This is the basic theology of exchange between God and Man by means of Christ's
Incarnation that was celebrated, and enacted, in the Christmas liturgy.
Padilla's villancico text puts this in musical terms, speaking of Christ as
"forming the consonances of Man and God" and concluding that "Everything in God
is to descend, and everything in Man is to ascend."
The musical setting even performs the concept through literal voice exchanges
between the ascending and descending motives.

These formulations not only explain God's action in becoming Incarnate for human
salvation, but also model how the faithful should respond---worshiping and
serving Christ with wonder and admiration, like the shepherds of Bethlehem.
While the Incarnation was certainly a dogma, a "rule of belief," even the
offical catechism moves beyond simply defining a theological concept, to include
an affective, devotional emphasis---a "rule of prayer" as well.[^lex-orandi]
The proper response to meditating on this "all of these mysteries," the
catechism says, would be "that with a humble and faithful spirit they should
believe, and adore."
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 50: "Hæc cùm attentè considerauerint, tum verò omnia
mysteria, quæ hoc articulo continentur, humili ac fideli animo credant, &
adorent: nec curiosè & quod sine periculo vix vnquam fieri potest, illa
inuestigare, ac perscrutari velint."]

[^lex-orandi]:
The idea of a "rule of prayer" comes from a Latin motto, drawn from Prosper of
Aquitaine, that has become a standby in modern liturgical studies, *lex orandi,
lex credendi*.
Rather than use the motto to create a dichotomy between belief and prayer---in
which "the rule of prayer establishes the rule of faith", as in
@Kavanagh:LiturgicalTheology---the intent here is simply to emphasize that both
faith and worship may be seen as integral and interrelated parts of religious
life in Christianity.
For critical discussion of the motto, with attentions to its actual origin and
its changing meaning in recent scholarship, see @Irwin:LexOrandi.

Wonder at Christ's birth is one of the primary tropes of Christmas, and
much Spanish devotional music seems designed primarily to cultivate this
attitude.
Padilla's setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* evokes wonder not only in the
words in the virtuoso composition and performance of the music as well.
The song that is the Christ-child is "as much to hear as to admire," the
villancico says.
The villancico aims less to instruct than to amaze, just as Mary Malcolm Gaylord
has said that the goal of elaborate Spanish poetry is "to produce effects of
astonishment and awe conveyed by the Latin term *admiratio*"---and indeed
Padilla's piece asks listeners to imagine a song that is "as much to hear as to
admire [*admirar*],/ as much to admire as to hear."
[@Gaylord:Poetry, 227]

<!-- admirabile sacramentum; tan de admirar; Gaylord on admiratio diss l. 1510

 - liturgy, Leo
 - Fray Luis
-->

In this case the term *admirar* has a more specific association, with the
liturgy of Matins.
Based on the piece's position in the musical manuscripts, it was most likely
sung as the fourth villancico in the Matins cycle on Christmas Eve 1657 at
Puebla Cathedral.
Padilla's *Voces*, according to a 1633 decree of the cathedral chapter, would
have occupied the same liturgical time and space as the fourth Responsory, *O
magnum mysterium et admirabile sacramentum*:

> *Respond.* O great mystery and admirable sacrament, that the animals should
> see the newborn Lord, lying in the manger.
> Blessed Virgin, whose womb was worthy to bear the Lord Christ.\
> *Versicle.* Greetings, Mary, full of grace: The Lord is with you.
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, 175:
"*Respond.* O magnum mysterium, & admirabile sacramentum, vt animalia vidêrent
Dominum natum, iacentem in praesepio: \* Beata Virgo, cuius viscera meruêrunt
portare Dominum Christum. *Versicle.* Ave Maria, gratia plena: Dominus tecum."]

The chapter mandated that while "the lessons should be sung in their entirety,"
"the *chanzoneta* shall serve for the Responsory, which shall be prayed speaking
while the singing is going on."[^Puebla-Matins-AC]
This villancico stood in between the lessons of the second Nocturne, which were
taken from a Christmas sermon of Pope St. Leo the Great.
This means that after a cantor chanted the first lesson, a cleric spoke the
mandatory liturgical text of the fourth Responsory above *while* the chorus sang
this villancico.
<!-- cantor? -->
The poet and composer were evidently steeped in the theological and liturgical
traditions of the Church, and had good reason to refer to the Responsory even in
situations like this where it was not sung.
For the learned cathedral canons, rather than diminishing the importance of the
Responsory, the simultaneous performance of the Latin prayer and Spanish song
may have actually deepend the hidden connections between the two.
Lay people outside the walls of the architectural choir would not probably have
heard or understood the words of the Latin liturgical text, so they would
perhaps not have missed much.

[^Puebla-Matins-AC]:
MEX-Pc: AC 1633-12-30:
"que a los maitines de nauidad deste año y de los venideros [...] se canten
todas las liçiones yn totum sin dejar cossa alguna dellas y que la chansoneta
sirba de Responsorio el qual se diga resado mientrass se estubiere cantando."
^[**XXX**  full text in diss or appendix ]

The Responsory evokes the scenario of the Nativity, with the animals gathered
around the manger, just as the villancico calls up the image of angels, beasts,
and humans joining together in song around the Christ-child.
In the quatrain (a *redondilla*) that closes the estribillo, the lines *tan de
oír y de admirar/ tan de admirar y de oír* actually seem like a reply to the
Responsory, as though to say that the mystery of the Incarnat Christ certainly
was an "admirable" sacrament---that is, one that can be seen---but it is also an
audible sacrament.
Listeners in Puebla could not visit the manger in Bethlehem; they could only look
at the retable paintings of the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Visitation of
the Kings and imagine.
^[**XXX**  chrysostom quote ]
But in the conception of this villancico, they could hear the "voices of the
chapel choir" reverberating in the space and through those voices they could
"hear the voice of the Father/ in tones of weeping"---that is, they could hear
the Christ the Word himself not merely speaking, but singing, through all the
other voices from the choirboys up to the angels.

In a widely disseminated model sermon for Christmas, Fray Luis de Granada
invites worshippers to turn from vision toward hearing:

> After the devout sight of the manger we open our ears to hear the music of the
> angels, of whom the Evangelist says, that when one of them had finished giving
> these very glad tidings to the shepherds, there were joined with him a crowd
> of the heavenly army, and that they all in one voice sang upon the airs
> praises to God, saying, Glory be to God in the heights, and on the earth peace
> to men of good will.
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 24]
^[**XXX**  full text elsewhere or original text here with page ]

More important than these angelic voices to Fray Luis, however, is the voice of
the newborn Christ himself.
Fray Luis begins the sermon by directing his listeners' attention to the
Christ-child, "weeping and trembling with cold in the stable."
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 9]
Fray Luis follows the exegetical tradition of reading Wisdom 7 as a Messianic
prophecy, such that King Solomon's words about himself may be applied to his
royal descendent, Christ: "I too am a mortal man like others, [...] and the
first sound [*voz*] that I m ade was crying like other children, because not one
of the kings had any different origin in their birth."
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 9; cf. @Lapide:Gospels19C, 670, on Lk. 2:7]

Fray Luis, as an avid student and teacher of Catholic Humanism, presents Christ
as an orator and philosophical teacher, a "Master of Heaven"---*Maestro del
cielo*, the same term used for a musical master.
He explicitly compares the voice of this incarnate Word with music:

> Oh fortunate house!
> Oh stable, more precious than all the royal palaces, where God sat upon the
> chair [*cátedra*] of the philosophy of heaven, where the word of God, though
> made mute, speaks so much more clearly, all the more silently it admonishes
> us!
> Look, then, brother, if you wish to be a true philosopher, do not remove
> yourself from this stable where the word of God cries while keeping silent;
> but this cry is greater eloquence than that of Tully [Cicero], and even than
> the music of the angels of heaven.
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 16:
^[**XXX**  first portion ... ]
"donde la palabra de Dios enmudecida, tanto mas claramente hable, cuanto mas
calladamente nos avisa.
Mira, pues, hermano, si quieres ser verdadero filósofo no te apartes deste
establo donde la palabra de Dios callando llora; mas este lloro es mayor
elocuencia que la de Tulio, y aun que las músicas de los ángeles del cielo."]

For this passage Fray Luis cites "a doctor," and in fact the whole passage is a
paraphrase from St. Bernard of Clairvaux.
^[**XXX**  saint titles? ]
The Latin key term behind the friar's phrase *la palabra de Dios enmudecida* is,
in Bernard's fifth Christmas sermon, *Verbum infans*---the Word who is both
"infant" and "unspeaking," since like the Spanish *infante* in Padilla's
villancico, the Latin word *infans* can have either meaning.
Bernard expresses the trope in this way:

> But what kind of mediator is this, you ask, who is born in a stable, placed in
> a manger, wrapped in cloths like all others, cries like all others, in sum,
> who lies unspeaking as an infant [*infans*], just as others are accustomed to
> do?
> A great mediator he is indeed, even in this seeking all the things that are
> for peace, not just going through the motions but working effectively.
> He is an infant, but he is the infant Word [*Verbum infans*], and not even in
> his infancy does he keep silent.
[@Bernard:Nativitate, 128A, Sermo V:
"Sed qualis mediator est, inquies, qui in stabulo nascitur, in praesepio
ponitur, pannis involvitur sicut caeteri, plorat ut caeteri, denique infans
jacet, ut caeteri consueverunt?
Magnus plane mediator est, etiam in his omnibus, quae ad pacem sunt, non
perfunctorie, sed efficaciter quaerens.
Infans quidem est, sed Verbum infans, cujus ne ipsa quidem infantia tacet."]
^[**XXX**  check all translations, especially Latiin ]

<!-- establish connection of these books to Spanish education and Puebla

Bernard is himself drawing on an older tradition of the theology of the Word
going back to St. Augustine, who reiterates this trope throughout his dozens of
Christmas sermons.
Augustine's editors even title one sermon *Verbum infans doctor humilitatis*---the
infant Word, teacher of humility.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1004, heading for sermon 187.]
^[**XXX**  him or his editor? which editor? ]
In another, Augustine preaches,

> [This day] is called the Nativity of the Lord, when the Wisdom of God
> manifested itself unspeaking [or, as an infant], and the Word of God without
> words sent forth a voice of flesh.
> That divinity which was thus hidden, was both signified to the Magi by the
> witness of Heaven, and announced to the shepherds by an angelic voice.
> This, therefore, is the day whose anniversary we celebrate in our ritual.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 997, Sermo 185, In Natali Domini 2:
"Natalis Domini dicitur, quando Dei Sapientia se demonstravit infantem, et Dei
Verbum sine verbis vocem carnis emisit.
Illa tamen occulta divinitas, et Magis coelo teste significate, et pastoribus
angelica voce nuntiata est.
Hanc igitur anniversaria solemnitate celebramus diem [...]."]

In true Neoplatonic fashion, Augustine builds a chain of signification from the
highest level of being---the Godhead and its incarnation as the
Christ-child---to the signs that pointed to this reality in the material world;
moving from divine Wisdom to the child in whom God manifested himself.
He then moves to the worldly signs that pointed to Christ at his birth, and then
links this to the present-day ritual of the Mass of the Nativity.
As the master of a theology of communication through sign and signified (in *De
doctrina christiana*), Augustine is teaching the faithful to hear the words
proclaimed in their midst (Scripture, preaching, liturgy) as signs pointing
first to the angels' song in Bethlehem, and to hear and heed the angel's
exhortation to the shepherds to seek out the "sign" of "a child wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in a manger" (Luke 2:**XXX**).
The Christ child they found was at this "infant" stage of life, not a speaker of
divine words, but was the very Word himself---as Augustine says, "a voice of
flesh."

Augustine uses the voice as an extended metaphor for understanding the actual
process of Christ's Incarnation.
^[**XXX**  which is why music can then be added on ]
Augustine uses the peculiar features of the voice to defend the doctrine that
Christ was not "changed" into flesh, but "remained the Son of God" even "having
been made the Son of Man."
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1002, Sermo 187, In Natali Domini 4:
"manentem Dei filium, factum hominis filium."]
^[**XXX**  rest of quote ]
The Word of God existed from eternity, Augustine teaches, drawing on his
learning in rhetoric and language (as also expressed in his treatise *De
musica*).
In its eternal state it "was not varied by punctuation marks whether short or
long [*nec morulis brevibus longisque*, a concept echoed in Padilla's *máxima y
breve*], nor drawn together by the voice, nor ended by silence."
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1001, Sermo 187, In Natali Domini 4:
"Quanto magis Verbum Dei, per quod facta sunt omnia, et quod in se manens
innovat omnia; quod nec locis concluditur; nec temporibus tenditur, nec morulis
brevibus longisque variatur, nec vocibus texitur, nec silentio terminatur;
quanto magis hoc tantum et tale Verbum potuit matris uterum assumpto corpore
fecundare, et de sinu Patris non emigrare?"]
But Christ as the Word took on flesh and became known to humans, Augustine
teaches, just an idea becomes a spoken word, without ceasing to be an idea.
In the form of a spoken word it can be communicated to those who hear it and
enter into their minds as an idea.
This is because for Augustine, a word first exists as pure thought before it is
spoken, but when uttered is "clothed in the voice":

> A word [*verbum*; or, thought] that we carry in the heart, when joined with a
> voice [*vox*; or, speech, spoken word], we bring forth to the ear, is not
> changed into the voice, but the whole word is assumed into the voice in which
> it proceeds, so that internally the idea the word makes intelligible remains,
> while externally the voice produces the sound that is heard.
> This word, then, brings forth in sound, what previously resounded in silence.
> The word, upon being made a voice [or, upon being spoken], is not changed into
> the voice itself, but rather, remaining in the mind's light, and having
> assumed the voice [or speech] of flesh, it proceeds to the hearer, and does
> not leave the thinker.
> The word in silence is not thought by means of this voice [spoken word],
> whether it is Greek or Latin or whatever other tongue: but rather, the thing
> itself which is to be said, before all other differentiations of tongues, is
> understood in some naked manner in the chambers of the heart, from whence it
> proceeds, being spoken, to be clothed in the voice.
[@Augustine:SermonesPL, 1002, Sermo 187, In Natali Domini 4:
"Sicut verbum quod corde gestamus, fit vox cum id ore proferimus, non tamen
illud in hanc commutatur, sed illo integro ista in qua procedat assumitur, ut et
intus maneat quod intelligatur, et foris sonet quod adiatur: hoc idem tamen
profertur in sono, quod ante sonuerat in silentio; atque ita verbum cum fit vox,
non mutatur in vocem; sed manens in mentis luce, et assumpta carnis voce
procedit ad audientem, et non deserti cogitantem.
Non cum ipsa vox in silentio cogitatur, quae vel graecae est, vel latinae, vel
linguae alterius cujuslibet: sed cum ante omnem linguarum diversitatem res ipsa
quae dicenda est, adhuc in cubili cordis quodam modo nuda est intelligenti, quae
ut inde procedat loquentis voce vestitur."]

<!-- diss l. 1909 summarize incarnation and voice and bring back to

Augustine is reflecting on language as a way to understand how Christ can be in
his body the form of communication between God and
humankind.[^Augustine-further-word]
Human thought is transferred from one person's inner heart and mind to that of
another by means of the external medium of the spoken voice.
The body thus converts an inarticulate, abstract idea into a form that others
can perceive through the physical act of hearing.
The voice itself, then, is independent of the body; it transfers the idea
to the hearer without the idea leaving the speaker's mind.
Theologically, in Augustine's conception, Christ as the eternral Word is like
the inner thought before being expressed in speech; Christ as the Word made
flesh is like the human spoken word.
Thus the Christ-child embodies divine communication not through spoken words,
but through his very body.
Because the Christ-child is both divine and human, he is both sign and
signified.

[^Augustine-further-word]:
For further on Augustine's concept of the Word and its relationship to language
and rhetoric, see the sermons *De verbis Domini* and the treatise *De doctrina
christiana*.
The theology of Christ as the Word is also exhaustively treated in Lapide's
commentary on the first chapter of John, @Lapide:Gospels19C, 872--889.

The concept of the *Verbum infans*, then, is that Christ as an infant cannot
speak words, but this is fitting since he himself is the Word.
This all amounts to an extended exegesis of the opening of the New Testament
letter to the Hebrews, which contrasts God's communications to humanity
through prophetic words with his final communication in the person of Jesus:
"Long ago God spoke to our ancestors in many and various ways by the prophets,
but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son [...]. He is the reflection
of God's glory and the exact imprint of God's very being, and he sustains all
things by his powerful word" (Heb. 1:1--3, NRSV).
Lapide connects Word and Incarnation thus: "We hear God teaching and preaching
from the chair [*cathedra*] of this manger, not by a word but by a deed: [...]
I have been made a little one, of your bone and your flesh, I am made man, in
order to make you God."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 673, on Lk. 2:
"Quid fecit tantus Deus, in tantilla carne, jacens in præsepio?
Audiamus ipsummet in præsepii cathedra, non verbo sed facto docentem et
prædicantem:
\[...\] Parvulus factus sum, os tuum et caro tua, factus sum homo, ut te Deum
efficerem."]
Lapide paraphrases St. Cyril on the Word in John's Gospel 1:3 ("through him [the
Word] all things were made"):

> An artisan [*artifex*] makes all of the works of his craft [*opera artis*]
> according to the idea, knowledge [wisdom], concept, or "word" [thought] that
> is in his mind: all of these comparisons are appropriate for the divine Word,
> or Son, who is Wisdom begotten, not made; and by consequence it is also
> appropriate to say that by him all things were made."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 877, on Jn. 1:3:
"Artifex enim omnia opera artis suæ facit per ideam, sapientiam, conceptum, sive
verbum mentis suæ: hæc autem omnia appropriantur Verbo divino, sive Filio, qui
est Sapientia genita, sed increata; et per consequens appropriatur ei, quod per
ipsum omnia sint facta. Ita S. Cyrillus."]

##### Christ the Word as Both Song and Singer

The signifance of the villancico *Voces, las de la capilla* as a source of
musical theology is that the poem takes this theological trope and interprets in
musical terms, and the musical setting embodies that musical conceit in sounding
music.
According to the poem's concept, the Christ-child is the masterwork that proves
the craft of the divine *artifex*---now a chapelmaster in the Spanish
fashion.
Bringing together *maxima* and *breve*, "high" and low in the incarnate Christ,
God the Father "proves" that he can form "consonances between a man and God"
(copla 2).
Thus on one level Christ is God's song, and "the Word" is envisioned not as
speech but as music.
Christ, then, takes the "lyrics" of his ancestor David, royal chapelmaster, and
"sets them to notes" (poem l. 7) through his heroic, sacrificial life.
He himself holds the *clave* (musical clef/key of authority); he himself is the
*divisa* (sign); and it is Christ himself who is *el signo a la mi re*, "the
sign of A"---the first note of a new song in which can be heard "the voice of
the Father." (ll. 9, 11, 24, 27).
This connects to a larger theological trope of the "new song," based on
Revelations **XXX**:**XXX**, numerous psalms, and other Scriptures.
^[**XXX**  examples of new song trope ]

^[**XXX**  FN Lapide on signum ]

The poem's "sign of *A (la, mi, re)*"---realized by Padilla through puns of
solmization on these syllables---connects the concept of Christ as the song to
that of Christ as the singer as well.
This theological tradition sees Christ the Word as a "sign," and therefore even
as a "letter."
Covarrubias glosses Spanish *divisa* with the Latin *signum*, from the Greek
*sēma*, sign; and Lapide calls Christ "the sign of reconciliation of the human
race to God."
[@Covarrubias:Tesoro, s.v. *divisa*; @Lapide:Gospels19C, 685--686, on Lk. 2]
Augustine connects the concept of the Word in Jn. 1 to Christ's statement in the
Revelation to John, "I am *alpha* and *omega*, first and last, beginning and
end" (Rev. 22:13).
"And just as no letter comes before *alpha*," Augustine preaches, nothing
precedes Christ or follows after him, "for he is God"---in the villancico's
terms, "the one who is before time" (l. 24).
[@Augustine:Opera1555, vol. 10, 118r, In Natali Domini 2:
"Sifides assit, aperta est ratio qua Christus nunc minor, nunc aequalis patri
sacris voluminibus asseratur, sicut ipse de se dicit, Ego primus & novissimus.
Indubitanter agnosce quòd priorem non potest habere qui primus est.
Item, Ego sum α et ω. Et sicut alpha litera nulla praecedit, ita & filium dei
nulli secundum constat esse, quia deus est."
See also @Lapide:Apocalypse1627, on Rev. 1.]

Augustine uses the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet to explain the
doctrine of the two conceptions of Christ, namely, that the Son of God was
begotten eternally of the Father, but born temporally of the Virgin.
^[**XXX**  catechism on this ]
Christ's status as the Word had no beginning, but there was a temporal beginning
to his life as a man.
Thus in the villancico the *divisa* signifies the start of a new *tiempo* (l.
11, 23).
To use Augustine's concept of voice and word discussed earlier, then, the
beginning of Christ's human life is the moment when idea becomes voice and
communication becomes possible.

What theological significance, in this tradition of theology, would be
attributed to the actual voice of the baby Jesus?
Bernard says the *Verbum infans* is "silent," and Fray Luis describes Christ as
an orator but makes clear that Christ himself *is* the oration.
Augustine's treatment of the voice is really a metaphor for Incarnation, not an
attempt to speak of Christ's literal voice.
But the concept of "the sign of A" in the villancico opens up the possibility of
interpreting the newborn Christ's inarticulate cries as an expression, not of
verbal concepts, but of his physical being.
Covarrubias begins his Spanish dictionary with this definition of the letter A
(pronounced like *ah* in Spanish):

> The first letter in order according to all the nations that used characters,
> [...] and this because of its being so very simple in its pronunciation
> [*prolación*]. [...] And thus it is the first thing that man pronounces in
> being born, except that the male (since he has more strength) says A, and the
> female E [pronounced *eh*], in which man seems to enter into the wrld,
> lamenting his first parents Adam and Eve.
[@Covarrubias:Tesoro, s.v. *A*:
"Primera letra en orden cerca de todas las naciones que usaron caracteres, \[...\]
y esto por ser simplicissima en su prolacion. \[...\]
Y assi es la primera que el hombre pronuncia en naciendo, saluo que el varon
como tiene mas fuerça dize A, y la hembra E, en que parace entrar en el mundo,
lamentandose de sus primeros padres Adan y Eva."
On symbolic alphabets in early modern devotional music, see @Kendrick:Jeremiah,
**XXX**.]

By this account, keeping in mind Fray Luis's description of Christ's newborn
cries, the baby Jesus first cried out with the inarticulate vowel *A*,
expressing in this sound his essenced as *alpha* and *omega*, as incarnate Word.
Of course, A is also the first of the musical tones alphabetically, and may have
been used as a common tuning pitch, as today.
^[**XXX**  evidence ]
The sound of his voice in this context expressed Christ's identity as the son of
Adam, while also serving as a tuning note, or intonation, for a new song to
replace the "wandering song" given to "the first man" (l. 34--35).
All the other voices of Christmas follow after and echo the voice of Christ.
Thus Christ in his cries performs the song that he himself is.
What the worshippers heard in the baby's cries was "the voice of the Father/
singing in tones of weeping," a "song/ as much to hear as to admire" (ll.
27--30).
This was not just an *admirabile sacramentum* as in the Responsory, but an
audible sacrament as well---the sign of the bodily presence of the divine
entering into their ears through sounds that were more like music than speech.

It would not be possible to realize such a concept in any more fitting way than
through a musical performance.
Augustine, Fray Luis, and Lapide all connect the present-day liturgy of
Christmas to the historical music of the angels at Christmas and ultimately to
Christ himself as the divine Word, *Verbum infans*.
Likewise, the villancico poem begins by invoking not angelic choirs or the
musical menagerie of the manger, but rather calls listeners' attention to the
"voices of the chapel choir," asking them to heed "what is sung" (ll. 1--2).
Only through "putting notes to his lyrics" can the composer fully enact the
concept of theological hearing central to the text.
Listeners are asked to pay attention not only to the words, but to "what is
sung"---which includes the sonic whole of the composition with its plays of
solmization, rhythm, stylistic allusion, and contrapuntal devices.
Through the voices of the Puebla chapel choir, the faithful could listen for the
unhearable higher music of Christmas, which ultimately meant encountering Christ
himself.

<!-- FN (Augustine uses the same phrase in Latin when he confesses being distracted by
the singer rather than by "what is sung")

#### Establishing a Pedigree in a Lineage of Metamusical Composition

<!--
(brief)

- Padilla is situating himself in a pedigree of compositional craft and
  theological learning, connecting himself to Santiago; differentiating himself
  from Jalón
- philological comparison with Jalón
- biographical links
-->

The high level of ingenuity, both theological and musical, in this villancico
makes *Voces, las de la capilla* one of Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla's
master-works, in the early modern sense of a piece that proves the artisan's
mastery of his craft.
As such, the piece served a social function in addition to being on object of
devotion.
For Padilla's fellow musicians, chapelmasters, and the educated elite of Puebla,
the piece demonstrated Padilla's skill and established his place in a tradition
of composition.
Evidence survives for two previous villancicos based on the same or similar
poems, though the music for both is apparently lost.
Padilla's setting is one link in a chain of homage and emulation, within a
specific family of villancicos as well as within the broader subgenre of
metamusical pieces studied in this part;
these pieces allowed Spanish composers to prove both their compositional craft
and their acuity as literary and theological interpreters in a tradition of
"music about music."

The two earlier versions related to Padilla's 1657 piece are

1. the villancico *Cantores de la capilla*, performed for Epiphany at the
   cathedral of Seville, January 6, 1647, probably set to music by Seville's
   chapelmaster Luis Bernardo Jalón; and
2. an even earlier setting of *Voces, las de la capilla* by Francisco de
   Santiago, Jalón's predecessor at Seville Cathedral, composed some time before
   Santiago's death in 1644.

For the 1647 *Cantores*, only the poetic text survives in a printed
leaflet.[^Jalon-Cantores-pliego]
For Santiago's setting, all that survives is the incipit of the text and a
description of the voicing, in the catalog of the music collection of King João
(John) IV of Portugal.
[@JohnIV:Catalog, caixão 26, no. 674; see also @Ribeiro:JohnIV.]

[^Jalon-Cantores-pliego]:
*Villancicos qve se cantaron en la S. Iglesia Metropolytana de Seville, en los
Maytines de los Santos Reyes.

private collection, courtesy of Gustavo Mauleón Rodríguez.

##### Version by Francisco de Santiago, before 1644

To start with the earlier source, the Portuguese monarch possessed a collection
of music that included hundred of villancico settings, many of them by Fray
Francisco de Santiago.
This Carmelite friar, born with the surname Veiga in Portugal, was chapelmaster
at Seville from 1617 to 1643.
[@Stevenson:SantiagoF; @Perez:DMEH-Santiago]
The Seville chapter had commissioned him to filled in for Alonso Lobo during the
elder chapelmaster's illness by composing the *chanzonetas* (villancicos) for
Christmas 1616, and then he was appointed as Lobo's successor.
Likewise, when Santiago himself was incapacitated by a paralyzing medical
condition in 1643, the chapter hired Luis Bernardo Jalón as an interim director
and then appointed him to succeed Santiago after his death in 1644.
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB] ^[**XXX**  + DMEH sv Sevilla? ]

Santiago had maintained a lifelong association and correspondence with the Duke
of Braganza, who after 1640 reigned as King João IV of Portugal.
Santiago obtained permission from the Seville Cathedral chapter to visit Lisbon
every five years (1625, 1630, 1635, and 1640).
Whether Santiago wrote music specifically for the royal chapel in Lisbon, or
simply brought John IV copies of his music from Seville, the Portuguese monarch
acquired a collection of five hundred thirty-eight villancicos by Santiago, not
to mention other musical genres.
Among the "Christmas Villancicos of Fray Francisco de Santiago" in the catalog
John had compiled and printed in 1649 appears the following title:

> *Vozes las de la capilla. solo. Ya trechos las distancias. a 9*
[@JohnIV:Catalog, caixão 26, no. 674]

Unfortunately only this description remains; the music parts probably perished along
with the rest of the collection in the fires that followed the Lisbon earthquake
of 1755.
No other piece with these incipits has been found in all the catalogs of
villancico poetry imprints.
The incipits match Padilla's text exactly, though Padilla sets the first section
(*introducción*) "a 3" and the second (*estribillo*) "a 6."

<!-- FN to show that this is introduccion and estribillo, cf Anton Llorente in
Sanchez Garza -->

There are several ways that Padilla might have known Santiago's setting of
*Voces* or the poem on which it was based.
It is quite likely that the two chapelmasters knew each other personally from
Padilla's early career in Andalucía.
Padilla, baptized in Málaga in 1590, climbed his way rapidly up the ladder of
prestigious positions in the region.
[@Gembero:Padilla]
He started as a choirboy at Málaga Cathedral, where he studied with chapelmaster
Francisco Vásquez from about 1602--1608.
Padilla's first position was as chapelmaster for the nearby cathedral of Ronda
(1608--1612); then on August 13, 1612, he began as chapelmaster at the
collegiate church of Jerez de la Frontera.
After his teacher Vásquez died, Padilla competed for the position at Málaga but
lost the *oposición* to the Portuguese composer Estêvão de Brito (1577--1641).
[@Stevenson:BritoE]
Padilla stayed at Jerez until he achieved a more coveted position,
chapelmaster at the cathedral of Cádez, where he began March 17, 1616.
He remained until 1622 when he emigrated to New Spain, somehow getting himself
into a position where, like Santiago had done for Lobo and Jalón would do for
Santiago, he was able to fill in for the chapelmaster of Puebla Cathedral
(Gaspar Fernández) in his illness in 1628 and then succeed him in his position
in 1629; he stayed there until his death in 1644, having groomed Juan García de
Céspedes as his own successor.

Padilla's years in Cádiz (1616--1622) overlap with Santiago's tenure in Seville
(1617--1643), leaving about six years when the two chapelmasters could easily
have interacted either thorugh correspondence or personally.
The two port cities, about 121 km apart, were closely linked economically and
socially.
Both cities were among the first to print leaflets of villancico poems, and
Padilla could have had access to the texts set by Santiago through this medium
alone.
[@BNE:VCs17C, s.v. *Cádiz* and *Sevilla*]
These imprints circulated widely and enabled provincial churches to stay
up-to-date with the latest trends; the most widely imitated models, judging from
the evidence of poetry imprints for texts set multiple times, were the Royal
Chapel in Madrid and the cathedral of Seville.
^[**XXX** such as Sevilla imprints in Puebla ]
Even in there was no personal connection between Padilla and Santiago, the
Seville composer's position at the helm of the flagship music program in the
Hispanic world (in fact, the mother church for all of the Indies), would have
made him a prime target for emulation, homage, or competition.

In fact, Santiago's appoiintment at Seville may have even precipitated Padilla's
departure for the New World.
The pinnacle of achievement for any Spanish composer, particularly one from
Andalucía, would be the chapelmastership at Seville Cathedral.
As Padilla built his early career, he must have had his eye on Seville, knowing
that Alonso Lobo was again and that his position would likely become available
in the next few years.
But when Lobo's health finally failed and Seville Cathedral had to enlist a
replacement before Christmas 1616, the chapter appointed the older and much more
accomplished Francisco de Santiago without publicly advertising the position
(meaning that there was no public *oposición*, as there had been in Málaga in
1612).
Santiago was still young enough that Padilla could safely assume the Seville
position would not again become available for decades.
Padilla had just started his position in Cádez---not a lowly post---but the
appointment of Santiago would have deprived him of any hopes of further
advancement on the Spanish main.
If he had hoped to work for the king, Mateo Romero had been master of the Royal
Chapel since 1598, and would remain so until 1633.
Another esteemed Madrid position, chapelmaster at the royal Convento de la
Encarnación, was given in 1620 to none other than Luis Bernardo Jalón.
This may have been part of the reason why in about 1622, Padilla sought better
opportunities in America.

##### Version by Luis Bernardo Jalón, 1647

^[**XXX**  connect Jalón and *Cantores* to Padilla via Puebla collection ]
The next known villancico in this family is the 1647 poem *Cantores de la
capilla*, performed in Seville, with music probably by Luis Bernardo Jalón.
The text corresponds closely to the text of Padilla's *Voces, las de la
capilla*.
The first four lines of both poems are the same, except that Jalón's text has
*Cantores* (singers) instead of *Voces* (voices) and *Niño* (child) instead of
*Rey* (king).
Most of the last half of the estribillo in the Jalón print is the same as that
set by Padilla, including the identical closing couplet.
Jalón's fourth copla is identical to the end of Padilla's *introducción*.

Though the text of *Cantores* predates that of Padilla's *Voces*,
the citation of a *Voces* setting by Santiago from even earlier combines with
philological evidence to suggest that *Voces* actually preserves an earlier
version of this textual family.
The general trend in mid seventeenth-century Spanish villancico poetry was away
from complex puzzles in the manner of Góngora and toward greater simplicity,
clarity, and conventionality.
Upon close comparison *Cantores* appears to be a somewhat garbled attempt to
simplify the arcanely Gongoresque *Voces* to make it suit the tastes of a
younger generation.

In terms of structure and meter, *Voces* is more intricately patterned than
*Cantores*: it features a *respuesta* section and a *linea de vuelta* joining the
last line of the coplas to the beginning of the estribillo.
The *respuesta* was more commonly used in villancicos before 1640, though
Padilla continues to use it in several pieces of the 1650s.
The *linea de vuelta* was a holdover from the rather different structure of the
courtly villancicos of the sixteenth century, such as those set by Juan del
Encina.
[@Navarro:Metrica, **XXX**]
Both Padilla's *Voces* and the incipit for Santiago's *Voces* contain the *linea
de vuelta*, "Y a trechos las distancias."
*Cantores*, by contrast, has no *respuesta* and omits this line.

The estribillo of Padilla's *Voces* begins with the *linea de vuelta*, followed
by a series of fully rhymed verse pairs, all in eight-syllable lines.
The half-line "uno a uno" forms a bracket with the other half-line "O qué
canto," marking off this section of paired verses from the closing quatrain, a
*redondilla abrazada*.
By contrast, the estribillo of *Cantores* begins with two lines with neither
assonance nor rhyme, followed by a line that rhymes with nothing and can only
scan as eight syllables if *que* and *lleva* are elided; the fourth line can
only be read as ten syllables.
The next four lines group in pairs with full rhymes, alternating lines of six
and eleven syllables.
These metrical irregularities are confined to this first portion of the
estribillo; after this the remainder is almost identical to *Voces*.
Thus the first section appears "tacked on" to the more refined pre-existing
material in the second section.
^[**XXX**  line numbers; poem in text? ]

In terms of theological and musical conceits, *Cantores* reads like an attempt
to take the dense *conceptismo* of *Voces* and both simplify and explain it.
The connection of Christ's voice ("the sign of A") and the "voices of the chapel
choir" is obscured, as the opening is changed to "singers of the chapel choir."
The crucial lines from *Voces*, "a la voz del padre oí/ cantar por puntos de
llanto," are missing as well, which makes it harder to make sense of "el signo a
la mi re."
The thematically central second copla of *Voces* is absent from *Cantores*,
obscuring the conceit of God as a musician and the newborn Christ as his
masterwork.
The connection between David and Christ as musician-kings is absent as well.
"The King is a musician" in *Voces* is changed to "the child is a musician"---so
that Christ is now explicitly the creator of the music rather than himself being
the Music *and* the musician.
Throughout the poems, where *Voces* has an ambiguous or cryptic line, *Cantores*
has a less multivalent one: instead of "a la voz del padre oí" *Cantores* has
"con que mil maravillas vi"; instead of "y aguardan tiempo oportuno/ quien antes
del tiempo fue" *Cantores* has "después que aguardaron uno/ que llegó a tiempo
oportuno/ quién antes del tiempo fue."
The *Voces* version of these lines is pithy but a bit arcane; the *Cantores*
version is crystal-clear but requires an extra line to say the same thing.

The *conceptismo* in *Cantores* is not as tight as in *Voces*: in many cases,
*Cantores* makes sense on the musical side but not on the theological side.
Some of the musical terminology is deployed innaccurately, as when *Cantores*
has Christ the composer writing in "compás mayor" in a "proporción abreviada"
using a "clave con tres tiempos"---it is hard to know which actual meters might
be indicated here.
The poet of *Cantores* writes multiple lines like "O que lindamente suenan!/ o
que dulcemente cantan" that do not advance the conceit, where the poet of
*Voces* restrained such effusions to the four-syllable "O qué canto."
The new poet has retained the technical terms and other key words used in the
first version of the poem, but has attempted to explain the metaphors, sometimes
in ways that change the meaning from the first poem.

A good example of this procedure is the way the poet has retained the word
*destreza* in the first portion of the text.
In *Voces*, the poet follows a mention of "the thirty-three" with these lines:
"Años antes la divisa/ la destreza en la esperanza."
The poet of *Cantores* replaces those lines with these:

> Una clave con tres tiempos\
> pone con destreza tanta,\
> que el pasado y el futuro\
> al compás presente iguala.

> He places a clef with three times [meters]\
> with such dexterity\
> that in this meter he makes\
> the past and the future equal the present.

This poet retains a numerological reference based on three, and connects it to
the idea of a "sign" and "destreza" so that the sign clearly indicates a
metrical symbol (ternary meter), and *destreza* now indicates the divine
baby-musician's compositional skill.
The poet does not use *destreza* as a *divisa* or motto as it is in *Voces*,
possibly taken from Tacitus's *spes in virtute*.
All the connotations of swordsmanship and heroic combat (which link to the
Matins reading from Leo the Great) are absent, along with any specific reference
to Christ's future struggle in the Passion.
The term's meaning is reduced to a simply musical one, and the rich theological
associations in *Voces* are lost.

These differences are consistent with the explanation that *Cantores* is an
adaptation of *Voces* to suit less Gongoresque tastes, and that it is not an
especially skillful adaption.
Jalón thus pays homage to Santiago by basing his villancico on the same text,
but also shows his differences from his predecessor by using an "improved"
version of the poem, and, one may imagine, a more modern musical style as well.

Jalón's position at Seville was the culmination of a restlessly ambitious
career.
He had left his post at the Convento de la Encarnación in 1623 to be
chapelmaster of the cathedrals of Burgos (1623--1634), Cuenca (1634--1642), and
Toledo (1642--1643).
[@Ezquerro:JalonLB]
On November 10, 1643, he was appointed chapelmaster at the cathedral of Santiago
de Compostela, but dropped everything a month later when he was invited to
assist Santiago at Seville Cathedral.
Jalón remained there until his death on April 6, 1659.

Jalón was present in Seville for the last year of Santiago's life, from December
1643 until Santiago died on October 5, 1644.
It is easy to imagine that the two composers had close contact during that time,
and in any case, Jalón could have had access to Santiago's music in the
cathedral archive.
Jalón's setting of *Cantores* was performed only two years after Santiago's
death, and it is plausible that Jalón composed the piece deliberately in homage
to his predecessor.
The Christmas--Epiphany season of 1646--47 would likely have been Jalón's first
opportunity to do something in Santiago's memory.
He was hired as an emergency substitute only a month before the musically
demanding feasts of the 1634--44 Christmas season, and it would seem likely that
the music for that first Christmas season would have been already chosen by
Santiago, or drawn from material Jalón had at hand and could put together
quickly.
Santiago died the following October, by which time the music for the 1644--45
feast would likely have been planned or even composed.
(For comparison, as will be shown in chapter 4, Miguel de Irízar in Segovia
composed all his villancicos for Christmas 1689 after September of that year,
based on poems available to him nine months previous.)
In any case, the close interval of time between Santiago's death and Jalón
setting of *Cantores* strengthens the argument that Jalón may have composed the
piece as a deliberate homage.

^[**XXX**  START Epiphany changes diss p 215 ]
Some changes in Jalón's setting bear evidence of adaptation for use in the
liturgy of Matins for Epiphany 1647 in Seville.
Where *Voces* alludes to the presence of angels, animals, and shepherds at the
manger, *Cantores* explicitly includes the "three Kings" as well in copla 3.
The slightly greater emphasis on the heavens, and on the concept of time
(musical and theological), might also be intended to connect with the visit of
these mysterious astrologers from the East.
But other aspects of the adaptation actually seem to make it *less* well suited
for Epiphany, in particular the omission of the line "a la voz del padre oí."
According to this piece's placement in the poetry imprint, as the second in a
cycle of nine villancicos, *Cantores* would have been paired with this
Responsory, drawn from the Gospel narratives of Christ's baptism (Mt. 3:13--17,
Mk. 1:9--11, Lk. 3:21--22, Jn. 1:32):

> *Respond.* In the form of a dove the Holy Spirit was seen, the voice of the
> Father was heard: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\
> *Versicle.* The heavens were opened above him, and the voice of the Father
> intoned. This is my beloved Son.
[@Catholic:Breviarium1631, **XXX**:
"*Respond.* In columbæ specie Spiritus sanctus visus est, paterna vox audita
est:
\* Hic est Filius meus dilectus, in quo mihi bene complácui.
*Versicle.* Cȩli aperti sunt super eum, & vox Patris intónuit. Hic est Filius."]

This chant would match well with the line about hearing "the voice of the
Father" in Padilla's *Voces*, when the piece was likely repeated with the other
1657 Christmas villancicos for Epiphany in January 1658 (with the typical
substitution of the villancico *de Reyes* for Epiphany instead of the *calenda*
that began the Christmas cycle).
But would be to the discredit of either the poet or composer of *Cantores de la
capilla*, performed in conjunction with this specific Responsory, that such a
key line, not only for the theology of the poem but for its place in the
liturgy, should have been cut.
It seems likely, then, that this version of the text was not devised for this
specific liturgical placement, just for the feast of Kings in general, and Jalón
selected the arrangement in the Matins cycle based on fairly loose theological
criteria.
^[**XXX**  Responsory performance in Sevilla? ]
The piece did not need to be a perfect fit liturgically in order to fulfill the
dual function of paying homage to Santiago while also demonstrating Jalón's own
position representing the new generation, the next step in the tradition at
Seville.

##### Establishing a Musical Pedigree
^[**XXX**  already used this ]

It is highly probable that Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla owned or had access to the
text of *Cantores de la capilla* from Seville.
The print with the text of *Cantores* is actually preserved only in a single
source located in Puebla.
It is part of a binder's collection of villancico imprints of the 1630s and
1640s from Seville.
The volume is held in an anonyous private collection in Puebla, and according to
Gustavo Mauleón Rodríguez, who is cataloging these holdings, this binder's
collection was originally bound with another collection of Seville villancicos
which is preserved in Puebla's Biblioteca Lafragua; both bear the firemark of
Puebla's Convento de la Merced and appear to be two parts of one original
volume.
^[**XXX**  check with Mauleón; Lafragua source ]
There are several correspondences between the villancico texts in the Lafragua
collection and those used by Padilla in the 1650s.
^[**XXX**  for example ]
These connections suggest that Padilla himself was familiar with these pliegos.
Padilla regularly used texts of peninsular imprints, such as his 1653 *A la
jacara, jacarilla*, taken from a Madrid Royal Chapel imprint of a year earlier
(E-Mn: VE/88/55).
Padilla likely kept his own collection of imprints (if not this actual
collection) as sources for composition, keeping current with the latest mainland
trends.

If Jalón's villancico was a modernization of Santiago's, then, and the text was
available to Padilla in New Spain through the imprint, why did Padilla choose to
set Santiago's original text (or an older tradition similar to it) rather than
the new one set by Jalón?
One possibility is that Padilla specifically wanted to differentiate himself
from Jalón and associate himself more directly with Santiago.
With his setting of *Voces, las de la capilla*, Padilla may have been trying to
show that he, not Jalón, was the true successor to Santiago.
Padilla was not able to capture the coveted position of Seville chapelmaster in
1616, so he may have wanted to demonstrate that he was carrying on the great
legacy of Santiago and his peers in the New World.
The modifications in *Cantores de la capilla* suggest that Jalón represented a
new generation and a new style, and his music was likely in a newer style than
that of Padilla.
^[**XXX**  any sources? ]
In 1657, Padilla was sixty-seven years old; only three years later, on account
of dangerously poor health, he had to write a "power of attorney" giving legal
rights to Juan García de Céspedes, who (like Padilla had done for Fernández) had
been serving as Padilla's assistant and would later succeed him.
[@Mauleon:PadillaCivil, **XXX**]
Padilla's setting of the older text may have represented the aging composer's
attempt to demonstrate an affinity with the older generation.

This chain of homage may shed light on the origins and meaning of Padilla's most
performed piece of Latin-texted music today, the *Missa "Ego flos campi"* for
eight voices.[^Padilla-Ego-flos-campi]
The piece has been assumed to be a parody mass bassed on a lost motet *Ego flos
campi* by Padilla.
But John IV's catalog lists another *Missa "Ego flos campi" a 8*---by Francisco de
Santiago.
Moreover, the catalog specifies that Santiago's mass was based on the motet *Ego
flos campi a 8* by Nicolas Dupont, a Flemish composer in the Spanish Royal
Chapel.
[@JohnIV:Catalog, 417, caixão 34, no. 787: "Missas [...] Ego flos campi, a 8.
*Ferta sobre hum Motette de Niculas du Pont*"; @JohnIV:Catalog, 381, caixão 32,
no. 767: "Ego flos campi, a 8, Niculas du Pont. *De Nossa Senhora*."
Based on this connection, Robert Stevenson speculated that Santiago, like his
peer Diego de Pontac, studied with Nicolas Dupont during Santiago's time in
Madrid; -@Stevenson:SantiagoF.]
(Neither piece has been found.)
For Santiago to use this music by Dupont, who may have been one of his teachers
in Madrid, was to connect himself to the august lineage of Hapsburg
Franco-Flemish composers going back to Dufay and Ockeghem.
It is possible, then, that Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla's *Missa "Ego flos campi"*
is not based on his own motet, but on Santiago's mass of the same name, and that
this represents another instance of Padilla establishing his musical pedigree.

[^Padilla-Ego-flos-campi]:
MEX-Pc: **XXX**/**XXX**; @Padilla:MissaEgoFlosCampi; recent recordings in
@Mauleon:PadillaPalafox; @Skidmore:NewWorldCD; along with many recent
performances.

This type of homage was a customary way for a student to identify himself with a
teacher or paragon, as we will see several more times in this study.
In fact, a similar homage was payed to Padilla by his organist, Francisco
Vidales.
According to John Koegel, "The Puebla organist Francisco de Vidales used
Padilla's *Exultate justi in Domino* as the model for his parody *Missa super
Exultate*, and another connection between the two men is seen in Vidales's
addition of a tenor part to Padilla's *O Domine Jesu Christe*."

Dianne Goldman has documented a similar chain of homage in several stages of
reworking a Victoria motet at Mexico City Cathedral through the eighteenth
century.^[cite Goldman stile antico article]

#### Singing about Singing

The metamusical villancico provided composers an ideal opportunity to establish
their own position in a tradition of compositional and theological
ingenuity---of musical theology.
The next section will show another example of this, in eight known settings of
villancicos from the same textual family by a network of interrelated composers
across Spain and into the New World.

For this study, Padilla's *Voces* serves as the starting point for a trajectory
of "singing about singing" in seventeenth-century Spanish devotional music.
The poem and music represent sounding music---including the "present" music in
Puebla as well as the historical music of the angels and shepherds at
Bethlehem---as *musica instrumentalis*, fully in accord with the Neoplatonic
system known from Boethius and many other early modern sources.
The musical performance invites listeners to contemplate the higher forms of
music, and above all the theological "Music" of the incarnate Christ, bringing
God and Man into consonance and forming in his own body and voice the perfect
*musica humana*.

In singing this villancico about singing, the Puebla chapel choir drew its
listeners' attention to the fact that they were singing.
The musicians, and so encouraged listeners to contemplate the higher levels of
music.
The listener would have the opportunity to listen for the voice of the sphers,
the angels, and most importantly, of Christ himself through the voices of the
chapel choir.
These higher forms of music would be audible only by faith, through the present
cathedral music which was its echo.
The exhortation in the opening line means that the Puebla "chapel choir" is to
set its time and tuning based on these higher forms of music, and that listeners
are therefore invited to "pay attention" as well to the verbal and musical
riddles presented to them.
Far from being a one-off occasional piece or crowd-pleasing entertainment, and
rather than being a simple didactic piece explaining doctrine, the complex
poetic and musical structure provides an object for aesthetic reflection as a
spiritual discipline, even inviting detailed analysis.
^[**XXX**  dell'antonio ]

But in order to contemplate the piece in this way, the listener must be equipped
with both faith and knowledge: faith to seek the higher theological meaning
behind the words and music, and knowledge to understand it.
Obviously, Padilla's villancico is aimed at a sophisticated listening audience.
The poem's double and triple conceits, some of them based on references to Latin
Scriptural and liturgical texts, require extensive knowledge not only of
theology and literature, but also of technical music theory.
Likewise, many of Padilla's musical puns---such as singing *máxima* on a breve,
the thirty-three notes of the respuesta, and the quotation of the *tonus
peregrinus*---would probably be accessible only to the performers themselves, if
even they were paying close enough attention.
Given the realities of hurried rehearsal schedules and the practical mindset of
many performers then and now, much of this artistry would remain hidden, known
only to the composer himself.
Because of its clear text declamation and distinct contrasts of styles, the
piece would still leave an overall impression on the less attentive and educated
listener, connecting the voices of the chapel choir with the voices of
the Christmas angels and the mystery of Christmas.

In this way, the piece functions not only for intellectual contemplation but
also makes an affective appeal to bodily, communal reaction and participation.
This function fits with the instructions in the Roman Catechism that the mystery
of the Incarnation is more to be marvelled at than explained in words.
Similarly, Fray Luis concludes his model Christmas sermon with a *peroratio*
that invites his listeners to join their voices and hearts with the worshippers
at Bethelehem:

> But consider, that if the angels on that day sang and solemnized this mystery
> with *Glorias* and praises, giving thanks [gracias] for the redemption that
> came to us from heaven, even though they themselves were not the ones
> redeemed, what should we do who are redeemed?
> If they thus give thanks for the grace [gracia] and mercy given to strangers,
> what should those do who were redeemed and restored by it?
[@LuisdeGranada:Xmas, para. 28; cf. @Bernard:Nativitate, 126B, Sermo IV,
"Et ut noveritis quo in loco selemnitatits \[...\] in psalmis, coelestes illos
principes praevenire conjunctos psallentibus, in medio juvencularum
tympanistriarum."]

The theology of Christ as the *Verbum infans* that underlies this villancico is
central for understanding how Catholics believed sacred music to function.
In the Catholic theological tradition of Christmas, Christ as the eternal Word
of God became incarnate, not simply to communicate "words" from God, but to be
in his body the medium of communication itself, as well as the message.
The point of the Christmas liturgy, then, would not be simply to "hear about"
God, but to encounter the incarnate Christ in his flesh, through the sacrament
of the Eucharist.
Lapide cites St. Cyril to say that "symbolically, the manger is the altar, on
which Christ in the Mass by consecration is as though born and sacrificed"; and
St. John Chrysostom to conclude, "That which the Magi saw in the manger, in a
little hut, with much veneration and fear approached and adored, you perceive
the same thing not in the manger, but on the altar."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 672, on Lk. 2:
"Sic et S. Cyrillus in Caten. Symbolice præsepe est altare, in quo Christus in
Missa per consecrationem quasi nascitur et immolatur.
Unde S. Chyrs. in Catena: *Quod in præsepio videntes atque tugurio Magi, cum
multa veneratione ac timore accesserunt et adorarunt: tu idipsum non in
præsepio, sed in altari cernens, majorem istis brabaris exhibe pietatem*."]
This is the Christmas version of the central theological concept for Roman
Catholics, Christ's presence in the sacraments.
As Pope St. Leo the Great epitomized the theology, "that which was plainly
visible in our Savior, passed into the sacraments [or signs, or mysteries]."
[@Leo:SermonesPL, 398, Sermo II de Ascensione Domini:
"Quod itaque redemptoris nostri conspicuum fuit, in sacramenta transiuit."]

All the audiotry elements of the service, from the reading of Scripture to the
singing of villancicos, could only point toward this physical sacramental
encounter.
But because of music's ability to work on the external sense of hearing and the
internal faculties of the memory via the ethereal medium of the voice,
devotional music could still play a special role for pious listeners---helping
them experience intellectually and affectively something of the wonder and
mystery of the Incarnation at Christmas.
The primary audience of this cultivated subgenre of metamusical villancico would
likely have been the cathedral chapter, who from their privileged position
within the architectural choir would have been best able to hear the verbal and
musical conceits, who had the education to understand the theological
background, and who participated fully in the liturgy by communing.
^[**XXX**  source ]
By contrast, since the laity in Puebla and across the Hispanic world would have
been unlikely actually to receive the elements, the common parishioner's
relationship to the *admirabile sacramentum* was primarily to look (*admirar*),
to listen, and to adore.

Padilla's 1657 villancico would have been performed facing a high altar retable
on which the actual altar was flanked by an image of the Adoration of the
Shepherds on the left and the Visitation of the Magi on the right.
This "Altar of the Kings" was completed by Pedro García Ferrer and consecrated
by bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza in 1649, thus places images of human
encounters with the incarnate Christ at the closest visual proximity to the
altar and central Eucharistic tabernacle.
[@Gali:GarciaFerrer]
^[**XXX**  place of tabernacle originally? ]
Above these images, the eye is drawn upward to ascend into heaven along with
the Virgin Mary, for Catholics the paragon of true faith and devotion, through a
"celestial hierarchy" (to use the influential concept of Dionysius) into a realm
of baby angels playing musical instruments like harp and organ, through a
group of cherubim dancing in the round, to the Holy Trinity at the highest
point.
^[**XXX**  who was bishop in 1657? ]

Like Palafox's own devotional book *El Pastor de Nochebuena*, these images
invite worshippers to imagine themselves journeying with the shepherds and
Gentiles to meet Christ in his lowly incarnation as an infant.
[@Palafox:Nochebuena]
In Catholic devotional culture of this time, the goal of contemplating Christ's
birth was to cultivate faith in Christ, including both faith as belief and faith
as action or faithfulness.
Lapide holds up the shepherds to his readers as an example of faith: they heard
the angel chorus and saw the sign of Christ in his manger, and then they went
and told everyone, and as Luke XX:XX says, "everyone who heard it was amazed at
what the shepherds said."
Lapide says Christmas shepherds were chosen as the first outside Holy Family and
the stable animals to see the newborn Christ because in their own humble poverty
they would not be put off by Christ's lowly birth.
For "however many might have approached the manger, and seen Christ, but only
those could have believed in Christ, whose hearts God had effectively moved;
while the others, taking offense at Christ's poverty, would have spurned him."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 677, on Lk. 2: 
"Hinc patet pastores multis narrase eq quæ de Christo nato ab angelo adierant et
viderant: quare multos præsepe adiise, Christumque vidisse; sed eos solos in
Christo credidisse, quorum Deus corda efficaciter tangebat, ceteros offensos
paupertate Christi eum sprevisse."]
The shepherds not only heard and saw, but believed because they freely received
the gift of faith, as Lapide explains in his commentary on John 1:12 (with a
polemical eye on his Calvinist compatriots in the Low Countries): 
"God gives the power to become sons of God to those who freely receive Christ by
faith and obedience, excluding those who do not with to receive him."
[@Lapide:Gospels19C, 882: 
"Hoc est enim quot ait hic St. Joanes, Deum dedisse potestatem filios Dei his
qui libere Christum per fidem et obedientiam receperunt, exclusis iis, qui eum
recipere noluerunt."]

If the listeners were to imitate the shepherds, then, they would not only listen
for the angelic choirs and look for Christ's presence sacramentally on the
altar, but they would allow God to  move their hearts to receive him in
faith---a faith that could motivate them to witness their faith to others, as
the shepherds did.
Christmas villancicos like Padilla's *Voces* and the related family of
metamusical pieces discussed in the next section appealed to the hearing of
worshippers on several levels, and opened the possibility for them to listen in
faith for the voices of angels and the voice of Christ.
Through compositional craft, the musical performance could also move listeners'
hearts to wonder and adoration.
