# Listening for Faith

## Villancicos as Musical Theology

> Faith, then, comes through hearing,\
> and hearing, by the word of Christ.\
> --- St. Paul, Romans 10:17


St. Paul wrote to the Christian community in Rome, "How are they to believe if
they have not heard?" since "faith comes through hearing, and hearing, by the
Word of Christ" (Rom. 10:16--17). Sixteen centuries later, amid the ongoing
reformations of the Western Church, Catholic Christians were seeking ever new
ways to make faith audible. Poets and composers of the Spanish Empire expanded a
genre of sung poetry in the vernacular---the villancico---into large-scale
choral and instrumental performances that could appeal to the ears of elite and
common people alike.

With the Church's active patronage, villancicos became a central activity in
religious festivals throughout the year, particularly at Christmas, Corpus
Christi, and the Immaculate Conception of Mary. Church ensembles performed these
pieces, with their motet-like refrains or *estribillos* surrounding a set of
strophic verses or *coplas*, as an integral part of Matins and other liturgies.
Festival crowds from Madrid to Manila also heard villancicos in public
processions and in conjunction with mystery plays. 

A large number of villancicos begin with calls to listen---*escuchad*,
*atended*, *silencio*, *atenci√≥n*. Because so many villancicos explicitly
address concepts of music, sensation, and faith, these remarkable but
understudied pieces offer us unique insights into Spanish beliefs about music.
Much of the valuable new scholarship on Spanish colonial music, and on sound and
sensation, focuses primarily on social and institutional history, and on verbal
discourse *about* music.

This book provides a necessary complement to these studies, by analyzing how
people expressed and shaped beliefs about music through the medium of music
itself.
