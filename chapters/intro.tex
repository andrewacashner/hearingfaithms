\chapter{Villancicos as Musical Theology}
\label{ch:intro}

\epigraph
{ergo fides ex auditu\\
auditus autem per verbum Christi}
{Romans 10:17}

\quoted{Faith comes through hearing}, wrote Paul the apostle to the Christian
community in Rome, \quoted{and what is heard, by the word of Christ}
(\scripture{Rom}{10:17}).
Sixteen centuries later, amid the ongoing reformations of the Western Church,
Catholic Christians were seeking ever new ways to make faith audible.
In Europe, church leaders sought to counter the Protestants' effective use of
popular song with their own kinds of devotional music that, like the new forms
of sacred drama and visual art, moved the hearts and instructed the minds of
lay people through a strong appeal to the senses.
Missionaries, meanwhile, were carrying their European chants and songs to
remote outposts and burgeoning colonial cities, where complex processes of
intercultural translation and exchange were already beginning to shape the new
sound of a globally mobilizing Catholic Church.

While we are beginning to learn more about \emph{how} Catholic leaders around
the world used music to connect hearing to faith, we still know very little
about why they did so.
How did they understand music's role in the relationship between faith and
hearing?
What theological beliefs motivated their practices of music-making, and in
turn, how did their musical practices express and shape their beliefs?
Moreover, if we acknowledge that there were many kinds of people who
participated in Catholic ceremonies with music, from different social stations
and cultural backgrounds, what can we learn about how these people actually
listened?
What was the role of musical hearing in their spiritual lives?  

This book aims to recover the answers to these questions from the perspective
of Catholic believers in the Spanish Empire of the seventeenth century.
The worldwide domains of the Spanish crown provided the geographical,
political, and cultural framework for a large proportion of the Church's
evangelizing and colonizing efforts, such that the seemingly spiritual work of
propagating faith and the comparatively worldly project of building colonial
civilization were in most cases inseparably fused (or confused). 
Though the earliest years of exploration (from the 1450s) and confessional
conflict (from 1517) deserve study along the same lines, it was in the
seventeenth century that Spanish churches began incorporating a genre of
devotional music in the vernacular as a regular part of worship services
worldwide---the \term{villancico}.
Villancicos originated in the late medieval period as a genre of courtly 
entertainment and sometimes devotion, with elements drawn from common culture.
In the late sixteenth century, Spaniards began performing villancicos as an 
increasingly integral part of the liturgy, interpolating them among the lessons 
of Matins or in the Mass, especially at Christmas and Epiphany, Corpus Christi, 
and other high festivals like the Conception of Mary and locally significant
saints' feasts.
Villancicos were composed in sets of eight of more pieces, most commonly
interpersed between the readings of the Matins liturgy and replacing or
supplementing the Responsory chants according to local practice.
Festival crowds also heard villancicos in public processions and in conjunction
with mystery plays. 
This type of sacred villancico flourished through the nineteenth century in
some places, and villancicos live on today in simpler forms through folkloric
traditions of Spanish Christmas carols.

Villancicos in the seventeenth century were a genre of complex musical
performances for multiple voices, often arranged in two or more choirs with as
many as twelve vocal parts, doubled and accompanied by large instrumental
ensembles.
Most feature an \term{estribillo} or refrain section for the full ensemble,
usually through-composed rather like a motet or sacred concerto, and strophic
\term{coplas} or verses for soloists or a reduced group.
The words for these pieces were in Spanish and sometimes other vernacular
languages including Portuguese, Catalan, and Náhuatl (language of the Aztecs),
along with pieces whose texts imitated the dialects of African slaves.
The music varied in style and technique from elements of common dances
and popular tunes up to the most sophisticated tone-painting and contrapuntal
craft.
Moreover, sets or cycles of villancicos for a particular feast like Christmas
included many different types of villancicos within them, offering something
for everyone.

Churches of the seventeenth-century Spanish Empire, then, became places to hear
faith proclaimed, celebrated, explained, and embodied through music that
appealed to the ears of many different kinds of worshippers---elite and common,
learned and untaught, masters and slaves---and where contrary elements were
juxtaposed in lively and sometimes unruly counterpoint.
Villancicos were ubiquitous in colonial Spanish culture: most major churches
from Madrid to Manila performed two dozen or more of these pieces every year
for over a century; and even after considerable loss of sources, there still
survive hundreds of musical settings (mostly in manuscript performing parts)
and vastly more printed leaflets of the texts of villancico poems.
This genre provides a window into Catholic devotional culture in this period
relevant to the lives of many thousands of people around the world.

Most significantly for this book, villancicos were first and foremost
expressions of theology, attempts to connect often abstract religious concepts
to images and experiences from everyday life.
The more surprising and puzzling the connection, the better---such as comparing
Christ to a gambling card player.%
    \Autocite{Cashner:PlayingCards}
Christmas villancicos in particular often brought rogues, buffoons, peasants,
and slaves to Christ's manger to offer songs and dances characteristic to
them--even Don Quijote and Sancho Panza make an appearance in one villancico.%
    \citXXX[Don quijote VC]
Until recently, scholars and performers have focused on a small repertoire of
villancicos that does not really represent the full range of pieces
that were commonplace in this period, resulting in a conventional view of
villancicos as primarily folkloric, secular (as in worldly, irreverent), comic,
small in scale, and primarily of interest for the traces they appear to
preserve of popular culture, particularly that of Native Americans and
Africans.
No doubt, plenty of villancicos do fit that description, but as I have argued
elsewhere, even these pieces need to be understood within a theological
frame---and we would benefit from thinking more deeply about what we can
actually learn from these Spanish representations of non-Spaniards.%
    \Autocite{Cashner:BuildingSociety}
If we look beyond the handful of tired examples, we find a rich and largely
unmined vein of poetic and musical sources that present complex and
sophisticated discourses on theological concepts.
More than that, we find pieces that not only describe but embody their
concepts, and that offered local congregations opportunities for theological
reflection, learning, and worship.

Villancicos of the seventeenth century were, as a rule, religious music.
They formed a central part of the devotional life of Catholic communities in
the Ibero-American world, and for this reason we need to understand what they
have to say about those communities' theological beliefs. 
We are talking about a genre of poetry and music on religious subject matter,
composed by professional church musicians typically under contractual
obligation to the church, performed in liturgical worship and paraliturgical
celebrations in churches and convents by ensembles funded by the church and
often consisting of clerics or monastics.
It should require no special pleading to argue that we need to understand this
music within the profoundly theological context in which it was patronized,
created, performed, and heard.

A large number of villancicos begin with calls to listen---\emph{escuchad},
\emph{atended}, \emph{silencio}, \emph{atención}. 
Because so many villancicos explicitly address concepts of music, sensation, and
faith, these remarkable but understudied pieces offer us unique insights into
Spanish beliefs about music.
When villancicos focused on the theme of music itself, most often by playing on
terms from music theory to build elaborate theological metaphors, they become a
sounding discourse on musical sound.
If a play within a play in seventeenth-century Spanish or English theater is
metatheatrical, then these pieces are \emph{metamusical}.
Through this genre of musical performance people embodied their theological
conceptions of music through the structures of music itself.
For this reason they may be considered as \quoted{musical theology}.

It is the central argument of this book that devotional music provided Spanish
Catholics with a way of performing theology. 
Making and hearing music was a creative pursuit in which people sought to forge
connections to God and to each other through musical structures.
The pieces studied in this book present a discourse about the theology of
listening to music in a way that also teaches people how to listen to music ,
and also teaches people how to listen to music theologically.
Educated Spaniards had studied both the theology of Augustine and Aquinas and  
the fundamentals of music on theoretical and practical levels. 
They had learned from Boethius how human music was linked to cosmic harmonies,
and they had learned from Guido of Arezzo how to sing through the gamut using
the mnemonic device of the Guidonian hand.
Metamusical villancicos brought these two domains of knowledge into a mutually
illuminating relationship.
Even in simply reading the poetic texts of these pieces, or hearing them read,
a person must know a fair amount of music theory in order to understand the
theological concepts, and vice versa.
When someone performed the musical setting of this kind of text, or heard it
performed, they faced an even greater challenge to understand the words as
projected through the music and perceive the ways the music depicted the sense
and affect of the text. 

I must be clear from the outset that the only question here is one of
understanding a historical worldview through its embodiment in a particular
kind of music.
Interpreting villancicos requires us to set aside our own religious ideas---or
anti-religious ideas---in order to hear the world through the ears of
seventeenth-century Spanish Catholics, to the extent we can venture to do so.
This will always require imaginative leaps of interpretation that will never
bring us all the way to the origin, and may in fact lead us to concepts the
authors and their audiences did not foresee.\citXXX[Ricouer etc]
But our goal is to build a sufficient interpretive framework that we can
recover a plausible range of meanings that this music might have had for its
creators and first hearers.
The primary methods for accomplishing this here are comparative study within a
corpus of pieces on related themes, in which it is possible to identify
recurring and developing tropes and conventions; and contextual study of
related literature and arts.
The related literature includes poetry and sacred drama, theoretical and
practical treatises on music, and several branches of theological writing:
doctrinal (explanations of Christian beliefs), exegetical (interpreting
Scripture), homiletical (preaching, applying Scripture and doctrine to daily
life), and devotional (teaching and modeling prayer and worship for personal
and community life).

For all its engagement with theology, this book is not a work of constructive
or normative theology. 
My only aim is to use the interpretation of poetic and musical texts to provide
a historical perspective on music's role in the religious climate of the early
modern Spanish Empire, one that acknowledges the many contradictions and
tensions in the texts and which seeks to connect the imagined world of these
texts to the real social worlds around them. 
Though I myself am a Christian believer I am not a Roman Catholic, and I
certainly do not subscribe to the worldview of seventeenth-century Spanish
subjects.
But this book takes no position on the truth claims of any religious tradition.
Understanding the religious aspect of historical listening practices in a
particular time and place may lead to a more nuanced understanding of
contemporary theology, just as it might hopefully enable more sensitive and
meaningful performances of historic repertoire; but that is up to the reader.
I also would not claim that the theological approach is the only valid way to
study villancicos, and indeed there is much more to the genre than the aspect
that I present here, for which I refer readers to my articles and to a growing
body of studies by scholars with different perspectives and priorities.

Nevertheless, the religious element of early modern Spanish culture is so
overwhelmingly evident to anyone who has visited Mexico or Spain or read any of
its literature, that it can hardly be justified if we overlook it or insist on
interpreting it through an anti-religious or anti-Catholic lens.
Instead, this book is for anyone who has gazed upwards in a Spanish or Mexican
church and wondered why there are so many images of angel musicians with harps,
\term{vihuelas}, \term{bajones}, and organs; or who has read a play by
Calderón, a poem by Sor Juana, or a devotional book by Ignatius of Loyola or
Saint John of the Cross, and has observed how often these writers use musical
metaphors; or who wonders what people thought was happening when they listened
to music in church and how they believed this connected them to God, to each
other, and to the cosmos.

These examples all show that theology was a major intellectual pursuit of the
Spanish and New Spanish elite.
As such it was a creative activity---not merely reciting dogmas
approved by the church, but playfully seeking out ever-new ways of connecting
revealed truth to observed experience.
Thinking theologically in an early modern Catholic sense meant building 
endless chains of association and allusion among Biblical texts, writings of
church fathers (patristics), medieval theologians, and the liturgy. 
It meant interpreting new texts in light of these old ones, and reinterpeting
the old ones in light of the new.
And it grew out of and reinforced a view of the world as a book waiting to be
read (see below).
One had to apply oneself to the effort of discerning how the sacred was
imminent in the mundane and common.%
    \citXXX[Chavez:PhD]

Much of the valuable new scholarship on Spanish colonial music, and on sound and
sensation, focuses primarily on social and institutional history, and on verbal
discourse \emph{about} music.%
    \Autocites{Baker:Harmony}{BakerKnighton:MusicUrbanSociety}{Irving:Colonial} 
    {RamosKittrell:PlayingCathedral}{DellAntonio:Listening}
This book provides a necessary complement to these studies, by analyzing how
people expressed and shaped beliefs about music through the medium of music
itself.
At the same time, the book offers a fresh approach by considering this music as
a source for historical theology, something few scholars have done.
The reward for taking this music seriously today as a source for historical
theology about music is a richer understanding of the intellectual culture of
imperial Spain and a holistic sense of how devotional music served theological
and social functions in communities, even creating relationships across the
Atlantic between poets, musicians, and institutions in the mainland and in
the colonial viceroyalties.
Villancicos allow us to hear how Spanish musicians, under the authority of
clergy, cathedral chapters, and as part of local elites, labored to make their
faith heard.
Because the pieces are so self-referential, they reflect on the very nature of
hearing and faith.
Through the many ways that the pieces engaged their audiences' sense of hearing,
and through the ways the pieces model musical hearing itself, they also offer a
glimpse of what a broader audience of common people listened for in music and
what powers they believed it had to shape their community.

\section{Hearing and Communication}

Villancicos were the most widespread form of religious music with words in
vernacular languages in the Catholic world after the Council of Trent, and they
provide evidence for a sustained endeavor by church leaders to establish
conventions of communication with ordinary people.
% XXX could mention other kinds of Catholic vernacular song (German, Czech?)
The creators of villancicos drew on common experiences of everyday life and
linked them to the sacred in inventive ways that met the spiritual needs of
specific communities.
Each piece provides a new answer to Christ's question, \quoted{With what can we
compare the kingdom of God, or what parable will we use for it?}
(\scripture{Mk}{4:21}).
Villancicos thus represent a key component of the Spanish church's effort
to use music to make faith appeal to hearing.
They are evidence of the church working to accommodate hearing and train it at
the same time.

This type of devotional music spoke to a variety of people at different levels
of understanding.
They were a central part of community festivals across the Spanish Empire,
performed both inside and outside the church, at Matins and Mass, in a multitude
of public and private contexts.
Each villancico cycles includes an array of subgenres that would speak to
different portions of the congregation.
These range from silly dialogues of Christmas shepherds that would have
entertained children and their parents alike to sophisticated meditations on
metaphorical conceits, such as the pieces based on musical terminology that will
be studied in \cref{part:unhearable-music} of this book.

Even the structure of individual villancicos reflects the effort to communicate
on multiple levels.
The \emph{estribillo} section of a typical villancico was scored for full
ensemble and performed at the beginning and then repeated at the end of the
piece; composers usually set this in relatively complex polyphony similar to
what they would use for a motet.
In the center of the piece, the \emph{coplas} or verses were usually set
strophically for solo singers or a reduced ensemble with accompaniment.
As Bernardo Illari argues, the \emph{copla} settings are probably based closely
on oral traditions for singing poetry, especially in the \emph{romance} meter,
to stock melodic formulas; and it would have been easier for common listeners to
make sense of the words that were sung to the simple, repeating melodies.%
    \Autocite{Illari:Polychoral}
The \emph{estribillo}, by contrast, is often much more complex and draws on
traditions of learned counterpoint; composers often invoke a variety of
stylistic registers and styles to convey the meaning of the words and heighten
their rhetorical impact.

But though villancicos have these aspects that seem designed to engage a wide
popular audience, they differ from other dominant forms of vernacular religious
music in this period---Lutheran chorales and Reformed psalms---in that they were
not sung by ordinary parishioners.
Rather, more like Anglican anthems and German sacred concertos, they were
performed by professional church musicians for the benefit of the congregation.
The printed commemorative chapbooks of villancico poetry, and the manuscript
performing parts of the musical settings preserve only one side of the church's
dialogue.
Catholic did not, generally speaking, cultivate a society of literate,
self-advocating lay people who would have left behind traces of their personal
beliefs and devotional practices.
For the Spanish Empire, then, we know what people heard, but not what they
understood or how they responded.%
    \Autocite{Burstyn:PeriodEar} % + Did people listen? etc.
And when villancicos represent types of people---such as deaf men, African
slaves, or Indians---they leave us only with conventional caricatures, not
ethnohistorical descriptions.%
    \Autocites
    {Baker:EthnicVC}
    {Baker:PerformancePostColonial}
    {Davies:LocalContent}

All the same, the devotional music that survives from imperial Spain
can still open a fascinating window into the process of religious communication.
First, villancicos should not be understood as an exclusively top-down
communication, and certainly not as a simple mode of religious indoctrination.
The creators of villancicos were not always members of the most elite strata,
and their readers and hearers included commoners.
The cultivated poet Francisco de Quevedo was credited with mocking \quoted{the
whole caste of villancico poets} as hacks, saying that \quoted{the poor are
drowning in poets, continually hearing their braying}.%
    \Autocite[37]{Torres:SuenosMorales}
If there is any truth to the critique of villancico poets as stringing together
clichés to satisfy the tastes of a lower-class market (an attack also leveled at
opera librettists in Italy), then the same low-class elements that those poets
disdained can provide us with insight into culture at a more common level.
On the musical side as well, some villancico composers were not prestigious
cathedral chapelmasters and we know of at least one who was of indigenous
ancestry, Juan de Araújo in Boliiva.%
    \Autocite{Illari:Popular}
%    \citXXX[non-MC composers, Illari]
Besides, regardless of their personal background, villancico poets and composers
had to produce something that met the needs of their community; though they
answered first to their cathedral chapter and the local ruling caste, it was in
everyone's interest to attract commoners to church and provide them something
that they would find satisfying.
According to contemporary accounts people turned out in droves to hear the
annual villancico performances, in annual traditions that in most cities lasted
from the first few decades of the seventeenth century all the way through the
beginning of the nineteenth.
%    \citXXX[audience turnout]
Somewhat like mass-mediated popular music today, this music was not typically
created by common people themselves, but it both reflected and shaped popular
tastes and attitudes.

\section{Hearing Faith in Community}

Catholic devotional music provided a practical medium for both appealing to the
ear and training it, though music amplified the challenges of acquiring faith
through hearing.
Catholic listeners were encouraged to doubt their senses as much as to trust
them; and church leaders struggled with the frightening possibility that some
people might simply lack the capacity for hearing with faith.
Religious ear training required individual discipline to avoid the danger of
over-reliance on subjective sensory experience and to learn to discern the
spiritual truth communicated through musical patterns.
This training would also need to discipline the whole community to overcome
misunderstandings based on cultural conditioning.

Propagating faith, then, meant trying to establish not just individual
Christians, but also building a Christian society as the body of Christ.
Faithful Catholics had to learn to submit their sensory experience to the
authority of the Church as the source of certainty, as the living, communal
embodiment of Christ the Word in the world.
For Roman Catholics, the Church \emph{was} the gospel, and the task of building
the Church could not be separated from the work of building an empire.

As Catholics worked to create Christian communities, music was a potent tool for
creating harmony, for instituting social discipline as a reflection of the
heavenly hierarchy.%
    \Autocites{Baker:Harmony}{Irving:Colonial}{Illari:Polychoral}
The virtue of man as Neoplatonic microcosm was reflected in the broader society
and in turn depended on it.
Spanish political thinkers conceived of the colonial project in terms of
establishing harmony in society.%
    \Autocite[22--31]{Baker:Harmony}
Most educated Spaniards were familiar with the medieval philosopher Boethius
(either directly or through expositions of his ideas in contemporary music
treatises like that of Pedro Cerone) and his concept that there were three kinds
of music: \emph{musica instrumentalis}, sounding, playing music; \emph{musica
humana}, the harmony of the individual in body and soul, reason and passion, and
the concord of human society; and \emph{musica mundana}, the music of the
celestial spheres.%
    \Autocites
    [\range{bk}{2}, \pagenums{187--189}]{Cerone:Melopeo}
    [203--208]{Boethius:Musica}
The proper performance of \emph{musica instrumentalis}, they believed, could
actually attune the \emph{musica humana} on individual and social levels,
bringing human society in concord with the order of the cosmos, and beyond it,
with the mysterious harmonious of the triune God.

Catholic music, then, was not \emph{about} society; it was a form \emph{of}
society.
This is why the Franciscan friars in New Spain and the Jesuit priests in Brazil
not only started parishes, but also trained choirs.
Forming choirs of boys and training ensembles of village musicians in colonial
Mexico were practical means of establishing the Church and propagating faith on
individual and communal levels.
The musical ritual of the seventeenth-century Church involved a large number of
community participants, for whom performing music with the body and hearing it
were inextricably linked.
The musical efforts of the colonizing church concretely built social
relationships through musical training.%
    \Autocite{RamosKittrell:PlayingCathedral}
For this reason, we cannot fully understand the faith of early modern Catholics
on the basis of verbal formulations alone; we need to see and hear how
communities practiced their faith through coordinated action---such as in
devotional music.%
\begin{Footnote}
    The Lutheran hymn composer Johann Crüger advocated a similar concept of
    \quoted{the musical practice of piety} (\wtitle{Praxis pietatis melica},
    1647 and many later editions), coming out of the Lutheran \quoted{new piety}
    movement of the seventeenth century, whose proponents (Martin Moller, Johann
    Arndt) were inspired by much of the same medieval devotional literature as
    their Catholic counterparts.
