\chapter{Making Faith Appeal to Hearing}
\label{ch:faith-hearing}

\epigraph
{Yo no te alcanzo ni tu enigma sé, \\ 
porque a la Fe he escuchado sin la fe.}
{\quoted{Judaísmo}, in Calderón, \wtitle{El nuevo palacio del Retiro}}

%{{{1 intro
%{{{2 sordos intro
Churchgoers in the Spanish Empire were familiar with many kinds of stock
characters who appeared alongside the shepherds and kings in Christmas
villancicos.
One of the most intriguing of these recurring figures is the \term{sordo}, a
deaf or hard-of-hearing man.
Poets placed the \term{sordo} character in dialogue scenes opposite a friar or
catechist, in which the religious teacher attempted in vain to overcome the
impediment of hearing and communicate his message.
In 1671, one such villancico was performed by King Charles II's own ensemble, the
Royal Chapel, for the feast of Christmas at Madrid's Convent of the Incarnation.
The music was composed by Matías Ruiz, chapelmaster at the convent, to an
anonymous poem, \wtitle{Pues la fiesta del niño es}.%
\begin{Footnote}

    83-12};
    \autocite{Grove:Ruiz}.
\end{Footnote}
The villancico is basically a skit in which a deaf man and a friar walk into a
church:
\begin{quotepoem}
    \speaker{Sordo} Éntrome de hoz, y de coz. &
    \speaker{Deaf Man} Here I come, like it or not. \\

    \speaker{Preg.} ¿Quién llama con tanto estruendo? &
    \speaker{Catechist} Who's that making such a ruckus? \\

    \speaker{S} Hablen alto, que no entiendo, &
    \speaker{D} Speak up, for I don't understand \\

    sino levantan la voz. &
    unless you raise your voice. \\

    \speaker{P} Bajad la voz, &
    \speaker{C} Lower your voice, \\

    que a Dios gracias no soy sordo. &
    for I am not deaf, thank God. \\

    \speaker{S} ¿Dice que está el niño gordo? &
    \speaker{D} Are you saying the baby is fat? \\
    
    pues de eso me alegro mucho. &
    well, that sure makes me happy. \\
\end{quotepoem}
When he mistakes \foreign{gordo} for \foreign{sordo}, the deaf man is not the
only object of humor. 
The catechist completely fails to accommodate the other man's impairment, and
the garbled echoes of misheard teaching threaten to make the churchman the more
absurd of the two characters.
In the deaf man's words, \quoted{the deaf are those who do not listen nor
understand the sound} (\foreign{que sordos son/ los que no escuchan ni
entiended el son}).
If, theologically speaking, the truly deaf are those who do not listen or
understand, then both characters in this scene are deaf to each other.
Perhaps this is why the manuscript parts call the piece \term{villancico de
los sordos}, using the plural for \term{deaf} even though there is only one
character labeled \foreign{sordo}.

%{{{2 thesis
This scene of mishearing and misunderstanding is emblematic of the Catholic
Church's central problem in the new religious landscape after Columbus and
Luther.
Whether speaking to \quoted{heretics} or \quoted{pagans}, whether debating the
meaning of faith with Protestants or trying to translate it for Native
Americans, Catholics often found themselves, knowingly or not, in
\quoted{dialogues of the deaf}.%
\begin{Footnote}
    The English expression is borrowed from the French \term{dialogue de sourds}
    to mean \quoted{a discussion, meeting, etc., in which neither side
    understands or makes allowance for the point of view of the other}
    (\autocite[\sv{dialogue}]{OED}).
    See \autocite{MacGaffey:DialoguesDeaf}. % XXX read
\end{Footnote}

If faith was to come \quoted{through hearing}, then church leaders needed to
find a way to engage the auditory sense, some way not only to make faith heard
but actually to make it understood, and to enable people to put this faith into
practice.
For this purpose many Catholics embraced music as a supernaturally powerful
means of making faith appeal to hearing, from the intercultural experiments of
Jesuit mission music to the programs of education and training for choirboys in
the cathedrals.
But the same problem of communication depicted \emph{within} the villancico
about deafness also affected the music of the villancico itself: what if the
music failed to communicate?
Given the potential for misunderstanding and confusion, how could anyone know
that \quoted{what was heard} in a musical performance actually led to faith?

This chapter explores the theological climate in which villancicos were created
and heard, analyzing and interpreting villancicos that focus on the link between
faith and hearing, in the context of theological literature, religious drama,
and music theory.
We will begin by discussing theological and literary sources that shaped and
reflected widespread notions about faith, hearing, and music, while also
revealing tensions in those understandings.
Then we will look at a group of related villancicos, never previously edited or
studied, that present musical discourses on the links between faith and hearing,
and manifest similar tensions.
The first two pieces stage allegorical contests of the senses in which hearing
is the favored sense of faith.
Other pieces deliberately confuse the senses to point to a higher truth that is
beyond sensation.
The last two pieces are \quoted{villancicos of the deaf}, the one already
discussed by Ruiz and an earlier example from Puebla by Juan Gutiérrez de
Padilla.
They represent characters whose impairments of hearing render them unable to
understand religious teaching, all the while poking fun at the futile
communication of some churchmen.

Villancicos on the subject of hearing and faith, I argue, provided a way for
church leaders to make faith appeal to the hearing of a broad range of
listeners.
They thus fulfilled one of the central prerogatives of Catholic teaching after
the Council of Trent, to accommodate the sense of hearing even while training
it.
Acccommodation meant adapting the method of communication---but not, ideally,
the message---to compensate for the weakness of the senses and the obstacles to
intelligibility caused by differing language, culture, education, and personal
temperament. 
Training meant exercising the senses, sensitizing and disciplining them to
create the capacity to perceive the church's teaching rightly and live
accordingly.
Villancicos, I argue, functioned both to make faith appeal to the
ears of a wide range of hearers, and to cultivate disciplines that would turn
hearers into listeners---people who heard the message of faith \emph{with}
faith, and who lived out their faith together as part of a harmonious society.

The poetic and musical texts of villancicos themselves may be read as discourses
on the process of using music to make faith appeal to hearing.
Many villancicos explicitly treat this theme, overtly asking hearers,
\quoted{Listen!} \quoted{Pay attention!} and even (in the words of a piece set
by Joan Cererols) \foreign{Callar y creer}---literally, shut up and believe.%
\begin{Footnote}
    \worktitle{Serrana, tú que en los valles}, in
    \autocite[205--212]{Cererols:MEM-VC}.
\end{Footnote}
People used metamusical villancicos to articulate their theological beliefs
about music through the practice of music itself.
A large proportion of the repertoire presents scenes of dialogue, such as most
of the examples in this chapter.
Although in most churches villancicos were probably not staged theatrically with
costumes, the pieces still feature named characters who interact with each
other, and the words and music evoke vivid scenarios.
These dramatized conversations paint colorful pictures of the sometimes bumbling
and misguided conversations between church leaders and their parishioners.

As the \quoted{villancicos of the deaf} demonstrate, problems could arise at
every stage of the effort to communicate.
Spanish devotional music manifests widespread anxieties about how people could
acquire the capacity to listen with faith.
Spaniards and their colonial subjects worried about how to listen faithfully,
about the role of subjective experience and cultural conditioning, and about the
possibility that some listeners might lack the capacity to hear music rightly.
Above all these is the danger that both the teacher and the pupil, performer and
audience, might be deaf to each other; that neither one could truly know whether
their communication had been successful.

If we listen closely to villancicos as historical sources for theological
understanding, it becomes clear that they functioned as much more than tools for
simplistic religious teaching or as banal, worldly entertainment.
These pieces often raise as many questions as they answer, but this tension, I
argue, was what enabled these to function as a kind of theological ear training.
The villancicos in this chapter appeal to the ear in order to give listeners an
opportunity to consider the challenges of faithful hearing.

%{{{1 sense most easily deceived: calderón
\section{\quoted{The Sense Most Easily Deceived}}

The sense of hearing had a paradoxical position in early modern Spanish
religion.
In the same scene of a Corpus Christi drama, court poet Pedro Calderón de la
Barca has his characters call hearing \quoted{the sense most favored by faith}
and \quoted{the sense most easily deceived}.
How could it be both?

The mystery play (\term{auto sacramental}) \term{El nuevo palaco del Retiro}
was staged in Madrid in 1634 to inaugurate the Spanish monarch's new
palace-retreat, the Buen Retiro.%
    \Autocite{Calderon:Retiro}
Calderón's play for the politically significant occasion glorifies the king as
the defender of the true faith, since his name \foreign{Felipe} cannot be said
without saying \foreign{Fe} (faith)---a faith that centers on the doctrine of the
Eucharist.
Since the Eucharist was believed to defy normal sensation and could only be
grasped through faith, much of the play sets up debates about the relationship
between faith and the senses.

If the King was the defender of the faith, then Judaism was its enemy, as
dramatized by the long portion of the play that centers on the allegorical
stock character of \foreign{Judaísmo}, the Jew who is unable to believe what he
hears.
The figure of Judaism becomes a chilling representation of the incapacity to
acquire faith, \emph{despite} the sense of hearing.
This was a stock character in Spanish mystery plays; like public Inquisition
trials these plays celebrated the authority of the Spanish church and state by
giving a hearing to its foes and then ostracizing them.
Judaism is forcefully excluded from the festivities celebrated within the play,
which culminate in the consecration of the Eucharist.
Instead Judaism stands to the side and asks the character Faith to explain each
event to him (\cref{poem:Calderon-Retiro-Judaismo}).
But despite trying to connect Faith's message with what he knows of the Hebrew
Scriptures, Judaism cannot accept any of these explanations.
In fact he is unable to believe what Faith has said, because, as he says in an
increasingly embittered refrain, \quoted{I have listened to Faith without
Faith}.

%{{{5 poem Calderon judaismo
\insertPoem{Calderon-Retiro-Judaismo}
{Calderón, \wtitle{El nuevo palacio del Retiro}, \poemlines{1303--1336}:
Judaism rejects faith}
%}}}5

Judaism's eloquent confession of unbelief is immediately drowned out by music,
as clarion fanfares announce a royal procession.
For Calderón's listeners, who had been taught to regard Jews as the embodiment
of willful unbelief and worse, the entry of the musicians would clear away the
acrid sound of Judaism's speech.
The feeling of doubt about the senses, however, pervades the entire play.

Two other sections of the play dramatize a contest of the senses, in which
Hearing prevails---but only after confessing to his own incertitude.
Each personified sense competes for a laurel prize awarded by Faith
(\cref{poem:Calderon-Retiro-Hearing}).
Each sense in turn boasts of his powers, but Faith rejects each one.
Hearing is the last sense to present himself, and in contrast to the other
senses, he speaks of his weakness, and how easily he can be fooled by echoes or
feigned voices.
Since he cannot trust his own powers, he must rely on faith.
In response, Faith crowns Hearing precisely because of his
\foreign{desconfianza}---a term that can mean humility as well as lack of
confidence and even mistrust.
What would it mean, then, for hearing to be the favored sense of faith not just
because of its humility, but because of its actual weakness?

Literary scholars have considered Spanish \term{autos sacramentales} to be
\quoted{dramas of conversion} with the primary goal of teaching
doctrine.%
    \Autocite{Wardropper:TeatroReligioso}
Dominique Reyre interprets this play as a straightforward medium for
\quoted{transmission of dogma}, and Margaret Greer analyzes it
anthropologically as a ritual that reinforced the king's power; but neither
scholar accounts sufficiently for the high degree of uncertainty expressed on
stage.%
    \Autocites
    {Reyre:Retiro}
    {Greer:Retiro}
Calderón presents one character, Judaism, who hears what Faith says but lacks
the faith to believe it; and another, Hearing, who admits that he cannot trust
his own sense but for that very reason receives Faith's favor.

In this contest of the senses, hearing can only lead to faith if one has
faith to begin with.
After the dialectical manner of Thomas Aquinas, Calderón uses the character of
Judaism to represent the antithesis of faith.
He can hear and understand some of what Faith says but he completely lacks the
capacity to receive it \emph{with} faith.
The character of Hearing himself is in a somewhat similar situation: he does
not trust his own sense.
Unlike Judaism, though, Calderón's sense of Hearing relies on Faith, and
thereby receives Faith's blessing.

In an empire where it was illegal to be Jewish, the depiction of Judaism might
have been aimed at crypto-Jews whose conversions were seen by Christian
Spaniards as insincere. 
It certainly added fuel to the fire of anti-Semitic prejudice.
But the play's real target is Christians, who needed to be reminded not to
trust their own experience or reason but simply to believe \quoted{the Faith}
guarded by the Roman church.

Both characters warn listeners that without faith, the senses could deceive,
and actually become obstacles to faith.
It is not just that the character Hearing has to trust Faith, but that in
facing the Eucharist he relies upon the words of Christ, \term{Hoc est enim
corpus meum}, that he heard spoken by the priest.
\quoted{The Faith} in Calderón's play is not a message sent by church leaders or a
set of beliefs received by church members; it is the Church of Rome itself as
the sole custodian of truth, whose authority alone grants people access to
salvation or consigns them to damnation.
The spiritual deafness of Judaism and the incertitude of Hearing apart from
Faith communicate to listeners, Doubt yourself; trust the Church; and obey the
king as its defender.
But they do not provide a clear path out of the predicament of hearing being
both the weakest and the most spiritually favored of the senses.

Music, instrumental and vocal, played a key role in Calderón's treatment of the
relationship of hearing and faith (though no notated music has yet been found).
Moreover, the play was performed in the context of a whole day of liturgical
and processional music, including villancicos.
The play's questions about the reliability of hearing were made all the more
pressing by how vigorously the whole festival appealed to this sense.
Later villancicos that directly addressed the subject of hearing and faith,
like those examined in the next section, provide evidence for a broad public
discourse about sensation and faith that manifests the same kinds of
theological anxieties we have seen in Calderón's drama.

\section{Well-Tempered Hearing}

%{{{2 overview Irizar Carrion poem
Two villancicos from the crown of Castile in the later seventeenth century
demonstrate that devotional music could present a sophisticated discourse on
sensation and faith, one that not only educated hearers about doctrine but
actually challenged them to listen with new ears.  
The contest of the senses in Calderón's play is echoed in villancicos by
successive chapelmasters at Segovia Cathedral.
In the 1670s, Miguel de Irízar set the villancico \wtitle{Si los sentidos queja
forman del Pan divino}, later attributed to the Zaragozan poet Vicente Sánchez,
for eight voices and instruments in grand polychoral style.%
\begin{Footnote}
   \sig{E-SE}{18/19, 5/32}; \autocite{LopezCalo:Segovia}.
\end{Footnote}
Irízar was born in 1634 and served at Segovia from 1671 until his death in 1684.
A few decades later Irízar's successor, Jerónimo de Carrión (1660--1721), set
the same text as a solo continuo song.%
\begin{Footnote}
    \sig{E-SE}{28/25}; both pieces ed. in \autocite[133--152]{Cashner:WLSCM32}.
\end{Footnote}

The poem invites hearers to imagine the senses \quoted{filing a complaint}
against the bread of the Eucharist because \quoted{what they sense is not by
faith consented} (\foreign{porque lo que ellos sienten no es de fe consentido},
\crefrange{poem:Si_los_sentidos-Sanchez-1}{poem:Si_los_sentidos-Sanchez-2}).%
    \Autocite[171--172]{Sanchez:LiraPoetica}
In a motto that is repeated after each copla, the poem admonishes, \quoted{let
the senses not resent it} (\foreign{no se den por sentidos los sentidos})---playing
on the word for \emph{sense} in several ways.  
Each of the coplas treats a different sense, following nearly the same order as
in Calderón's play: Sight comes first, followed by Touch; next are Taste and
Smell, and Hearing comes last and wins the day (\cref{tab:senses-order}).

\subsection{Irízar: Battle of the Senses}

The two surviving settings of this poem by Irízar and Carrión stage this
contest of the senses in sound.
The Segovia Cathedral archive preserves manuscript performing parts for both
settings along with Irízar's draft score for his version.%
\begin{Footnote}
    The performing parts for Irízar's setting are in \sig{E-SE}{5/32} (in a
    copyist's hand), and \sig{E-SE}{18/19} contains the the score in the
    composer's own hand.
    Carrión's performing parts are in \sig{E-SE}{28/25}.
\end{Footnote}
As rare as composers' scores of villancicos are, Irízar's manuscripts are doubly
valuable because this economical composer drafted his music in makeshift
notebooks stitched together from piles of his received letters, fitting up to
twelve staves of music in the margins and unused sides of the paper.%
    \Autocites
    {LopezCalo:IrizarLetters1}
    {Olarte:Irizar}
The letters reflect a correspondence with a broad peninsular network of
musicians, often about exchanging villancico poetry.%
    \Autocite{Rodriguez:Networks}
Irízar probably received this poem through such correspondence with a colleague
in Zaragoza.
Carrión likely knew (and probably performed) Irízar's setting from the archive,
but the differences between his text and that of Irízar suggest that Carrión had
a separate source for the Sánchez poem, one that was closer to the poem
published in Sánchez's 1688 posthumous works.%
    \Autocite[171--172]{Sanchez:LiraPoetica}

In the earlier setting, for Corpus Christi 1674, Irízar creates a musical
competition in festival style by pitting his two four-voice choirs against each
other in polychoral dialogue (\cref{mux:Irizar-Si_los_sentidos}).%
\begin{Footnote}
    \Autocite[133--148]{Cashner:WLSCM32}.  
    The score includes the heading, \quoted{Fiesta del SSantissimo de este año
    del 1674}.
\end{Footnote}
Going beyond the typical polychoral texture, Irízar has the choirs interrupt
each other in ways that create not just a dialogue, but a debate.
Like a film editor creating a fight scene, Irízar builds intensity by cutting
the text into shorter phrases to be tossed back and forth between the two
choirs: \foreign{no se den por sentidos} becomes \foreign{no se den} and then
\foreign{no, no}.

%{{{5 music Irizar si los sentidos

(\sig{E-SE}{18/19, 5/32})}
%}}5}

Irízar creates a steadily increasing sense of excitement through shifts of
rhythmic motion and style.
The setting of the opening phrase suggests a tone of solemnity: the voices sing
relatively low in their registers, with a slow harmonic rhythm, and pause for
prominent breaths (\measures{1--9}).
The harmonies here change less frequently than in the following sections,
creating a relatively static feeling for this introduction.
In \measure{10} Irízar has the ensemble switch to ternary meter and increases
the rate of harmonic motion.
The sense of antagonism is heightened when one choir interrupts the other with
exclamations of \foreign{no} on normally weak beats (\measures{16--17}).
When Irízar returns to duple meter in \measure{25}, the voices move in smaller
note values (\foreign{corcheas}) and exchange shorter phrases, so that the tempo
feels faster.
Each choir's entrances become more emphatic, repeating tones in simple triads,
and Irízar adds more offbeat accents and syncopations, particularly for \foreign{no
se den por sentidos los sentidos} in \measures{32--53}.
The estribillo builds to a climactic \term{peroratio} (the rousing conclusion of
an oration) with the voices breaking into imitative texture in descending
melodic lines.

The distinguishing stylistic characteristics of the setting suggest that Irízar
is evoking a musical battle topic, a style one may find in \term{batallas} for
organ as well as other villancicos on military themes.%
\begin{Footnote}
    \Autocites
    [\sv{battle music}]{Grove}
    [288--294]{Illari:Polychoral}.
    \Autocite{Sutton:IberianBatalla} discusses examples including those in
    Martín y Coll's \wtitle{Huerto ameno de flores de música} (Madrid, 1709).
    Another villancico in this style is Antonio de Salazar's \wtitle{Al campo, a
    la batalla} (\sig{MEX-Mc}{A28}).
\end{Footnote}
Battle pieces typically feature a slow, peaceful introduction followed by
sections in contrasting meters and styles and a texture of dialogue between
opposing groups (as in between high and low registers on the keyboard).  
Typical of the style is the reiteration of \musFig{5 3} (\quoted{root
position}) chord voicings, with the bass moving by fourths and fifths, and the
syncopated 3--3--2 groupings of \term{corcheas} (eighth notes) on \foreign{no se
den por sentidos los sentidos} as in \measures{31--33}.%
\begin{Footnote}
    Compare, for example, the anonymous \term{Batalha} in \sig{P-BRad}{Ms.963},
    \range{fol}{56}; \autocite{Araujo:Batalla}.  
\end{Footnote}

Irízar sets the coplas, by contrast, in a sober and deliberate style.
The melody moves more calmly in duple meter with melodic phrases that fit well
with the rhetorical structure of the poetic strophes.  
Irízar has the treble soloist sing the third and fourth lines of each strophe in
short paired phrases; each time the second phrase repeats the first, transposed
down a fifth.
This creates a feeling of a teacher saying \quoted{on the one hand} and
\quoted{on the other hand} that suits the philosophical tone of the strophes.

%{{{2 Carrion
\subsection{Carríon: Internal Conflict}

Irízar's villancico seems to speak to a large crowd through bold, unsubtle
gestures and sharp contrasts of bright colors.
Jerónimo de Carrión's later setting of the same poem invites a more personal
reflection (\cref{mux:Carrion-Si_los_sentidos}).%
    \Autocite[149--152]{Cashner:WLSCM32}
Carrión was capable of the festival style, as in his \wtitle{Qué destemplada
armonía} (\sig{E-SE}{20/5}), which almost takes on the dimensions of a
\term{cantada}.  
But this setting fits more in the subgenre of \term{tono divino} or chamber
villancico, a continuo song used in more intimate settings like Eucharistic
devotion.%
    \Autocite[See, for example][]{Robledo:MadridTonos}
The style, as in other Spanish music of the later seventeenth century, is
similar to the \quoted{high Baroque} music of contemporary Italy, with a tonal
harmonic language, a running bass part in the accompaniment, and a single
affective manner throughout.

%{{{5 music Carrion Si los sentidos)
\insertMusic{Carrion-Si_los_sentidos}
{Jerónimo de Carrión, \wtitle{Si los sentidos queja forman del pan divino}

%}}}5

The dialogue and rivalry of the poetic text is embodied now not through
polychoral effects but through motivic exchanges between voice and
accompaniment.
Instead of metrical contrasts from one section to the next, Carrión creates
rhythmic contrasts between simultaneous voices.
Carrión dramatizes \foreign{queja} (\measures{3--4}) with a metrical disagreement
between the two voices (normal ternary motion in the accompaniment versus
sesquialtera in the voice).
The descending pattern of leaps for \foreign{porque lo que ellos sienten} perhaps
depicts the senses in tumult, and it creates a certain amount of rhythmic
confusion as it moves between voices.
Carrión creates a climax through a series of phrases in close imitation between
soloist and accompaniment in \measures{18--32} that leads the singer to the top
of his register in \measures{35--37}.
The upward leaps in the last line on \foreign{no se den} (\measures{41--42})
contrast with the downward leaping motive of the opening gesture on
\foreign{sentidos} (\measure{1}).
The solo setting allows the singer and instrumentalists much more expressive
freedom than is possible in a large-ensemble texture, and likewise the
individual voice of the singer might encourage a more subjective response in
individual listeners.

%{{{2 sensory confusion
\subsection{Sensory Confusion}

While the \wtitle{Si los sentidos} villancicos may not project as much
uncertainty about sensation and faith as does Calderón's \wtitle{El nuevo
palacio del Retiro}, they still emphasize the need for all the senses to submit
to faith, which means that listeners should not trust their senses alone.
Some villancico poets and composers go further than stating that senses can be
deceitful; they use paradox to deliberately confuse the senses for pious
purposes.
We have already seen in \cref{ch:intro} that many villancicos feature auditory
\quoted{special effects} like echoes, voices imitating instruments, and voices
imitating birdsong.
Such pieces might be compared to the contemporary rise of \term{trompe l'oeil}
effects in visual art, like the illusion of the heavens opening in the
\term{Transparente} of Toledo Cathedral (by Narciso Tomé, 1732) or the false
domes painted by Andrea Pozzo and his students on Jesuit church ceilings from
Rome to China.%
    \Autocites
    [\sv{Tomé, Narciso}]{GroveArt}
    [110]{Bailey:Art}

Villancicos with \quoted{synesthetic} topics mismatch the senses in the spirit
of paradox and enigma.%
\begin{Footnote}
    \Autocite{DoetschKraus:Sinestesia} explores connections between poetic
    \quoted{synthesis of the senses} in Spanish verse and the actual
    neurological phenomenon of synesthesia.  
    For example, sight and hearing are the principal objects in the anonymous
    Marian fragment \wtitle{Porque cuando las voces puedan pintarla} (If voices
    could only paint her, \sig{E-Mn}{M3881/44}).
\end{Footnote}
Cristóbal Galán juxtaposes hearing and vision in a villancico for the Conception

Galán was master of the Royal Chapel from 1680 to 1684, and to judge from copies
of his works in multiple archives, his works were performed all across the
empire and likely served as models for provincial composers who wanted to stay
current with trends in Madrid.

to 1667.%

Galán's text exhorts listeners to \quoted{hear the bird} and \quoted{see the

Monastery of the Encarnación in Madrid, where the Royal Chapel frequently

The poem makes \foreign{equivocación} (confusion) of sight and hearing, which is

In his musical setting for eleven voices in three choirs, Galán creates
\foreign{equivocación} through rhythm, notation, and texture.  
Galán juxtaposes the three voices of Chorus I against the other two choirs by
having Chorus I sing primarily in a normal triple-meter motion (with dotted
figures intensifying the ternary feeling), while the other two choirs interject
\foreign{¡Oigan!} and \foreign{¡Miran!} in sesquialtera rhythm.

To notate these rhythms, Galán must use white notes for the regular ternary
motion in Chorus I, but blackened noteheads (mensural coloration) to indicate
the hemiola pattern in the other choirs.
But when each voice in Chorus I sings the synesthetic phrase \quoted{the light
is heard to shine}, Galán turns the lights out---on the page at least---by
giving each voice a passage in all black-note sesquialtera
(\cref{fig:Galan-Oigan-coloratio}).
They return to white notation again for the following phrase, \quoted{while the
voice is seen in purity}.
Any attentive listener could hear these juxtapositions and abrupt shifts in
rhythmic patterns, though only the musicians themselves would likely have
recognized the dark--light symbolism in the notation.%

For \foreign{qué equivocación} (\quoted{what confusion!}) Galán creates a
sudden flurry of contrapuntal motion: this outburst of polyphonic texture in
the midst of primarily homophonic polychoral dialogue could create an affective
sense of confusion.
The fugato here also paints the word \foreign{equivocación} in a literal way---by
having \quoted{equal voices} sing a long ascending scalar figure in imitation
(starting with the Tiple II's stepwise ascent \pitch{A}{4}--\pitch{G}{5}).
As the estribillo continues, Galán increasingly mixes up the music for
\foreign{Oigan todos del ave}, the sesquialtera interjections, and the contrapuntal
texture of \foreign{qué equivocación}, between the various choirs.
Pieces like this describe and seek to incite a condition of sensory overload, an
ecstasy in which all the senses blend together in the effort to grasp something
that is beyond them.

\subsection{The Triumph of Hearing}

These villancicos, along with Calderón's drama, reflect a common physiological
model of sensation and perception, as educated Spaniards would have learned
from scientific and theological treatises in seminary and convent libraries.%   
\begin{Footnote}
    Puebla's Biblioteca Palafoxiana, which combines the private library of Bishop
    Juan de Palafox y Mendoza with the former libraries of the local seminaries
    and convents, gives a good sense of the range of such literature available
    in imperial Spain.
\end{Footnote}
A typical example is the 1557 natural-philosophy textbook \wtitle{Phisica,
Speculatio} by an Augustinian friar in New Spain, Alphonsus à Veracruce.%
    \Autocite{Veracruce:Phisica}
Veracruce summarizes the traditional Catholic teaching, which drew on Aristotle
as interpreted by Aquinas, and his theories are consistent with those of Fray
Luis de Granada.

Spanish philosophers taught that vision, not hearing, was the first and highest
of the five exterior senses; but hearing superseded the other senses in matters
of faith.
As Fray Luis explains this widespread understanding of perception, the five
exterior senses were linked to a set of interior senses or faculties, including
the affective faculty, in which the sensory stimuli interacted with the balance
of bodily humors (\cref{tab:senses-fray-luis}).%
    \Autocite
    [\range{ch}{27--35}, \pagenums{439--494}]
    {LuisdeGranada-Balcells:SimboloPtI}
The five exterior senses mediated between the outside world and the interior
senses by means of the ethereal \term{spiritus animales}, which were something
like invisible beams of light that flowed through the nerves.  
The cerebrum housed the internal faculties, which \quoted{made sense} of what
the external senses told them---first the \quoted{common sense}, a kind of
reception area where the exterior senses met the interior faculties; and next
the imagination, the cogitative faculty, and memory.
All of these exterior and interior senses were part of the \term{ánima
sensitiva}, the sensing, reasoning soul.
In addition to these senses the \term{ánima sensitiva} possessed an affective
faculty, in which the balance of humors in the body interacted with the interior
and exterior senses to produce different \quoted{passions} or \quoted{affects}
(Fray Luis uses \term{pasiones} and \term{afectos} interchangeably).
Based on a fundamental dichotomy like magnetism between attraction and
repulsion, this \quoted{concupiscible} part of the soul experienced three
primary pairs of passions: love and hate, desire and fear, joy and sadness.

%{{{5 table
\insertTable{senses-fray-luis}
{The senses and faculties of the sensible soul (\term{ánima sensitiva}),
according to Fray Luis de Granada}
%}}5}

The act of sensation, then, involved the entire body and soul, in a holistic
model (later challenged by Descartes).
The external senses differed, though, in how they connected the external world
to the internal faculties and passions.
The hierarchy of the senses was determined by the degree of mediation between
the object of sensation and the person sensing.
The most base sense was taste, because the person actually had to physically
consume the object of sensation.
The most powerful sense was sight, since it enabled a person to perceive objects
a great distance away without any direct contact.

Hearing stood out from the other senses because for it alone, the object of
perception was not identical with the thing sensed.
As Calderón's character Hearing says, \quoted{Sight sees, without doubting/ what
she sees; Smell smells/ what he smells; Touch touches/ what he touches, and
Taste tastes/ what he tastes, since the object/ is proximate \add{immediate} to
the action}.%
    \Autocite[\poemlines{577--582}]{Calderon:Retiro}
But Hearing hears a person's voice, not the person directly, as Calderón's text
continues: \quoted{But what Hearing hears/ is only a fleeting echo,/ born of a
distant voice/ without a known object}.%
    \Autocite[\poemlines{583--586}]{Calderon:Retiro}
While this feature of hearing may have made it \quoted{easily deceived}, it also
gave this sense a unique capability in spiritual matters, where the object of
perception was not immediately sensible at all.

The poetic contests of the senses thus rearrange the traditional scholastic
hierarchy by putting Hearing at the end for a dramatic climax.
Sight comes first, but Hearing, the underdog competitor, triumphs at the
last.
\begin{Footnote}
    Irízar alone (perhaps working from an earlier version of the text later
    attributed to Sánchez), puts Hearing in its traditional position, though
    this goes against the spirit of the poetic text.  
    Perhaps he was influenced by a scholastic training to \quoted{correct} the
    philosophical order.
\end{Footnote}
In the Sánchez villancico, each of the coplas highlights the failure of one of
the senses to rightly perceive the sacrament.
For example, the eyes \quoted{do not look at what they see}, and the Eucharist
reduces Sight to \quoted{blindness} (copla 1).
The \quoted{colors} and \quoted{rays of light} through which Sight normally
operates are \quoted{hidden} \quoted{beneath transparent veils} and
\quoted{transformed} so that \quoted{God Incarnate is not seen} (copla 2).
Similarly, Touch may make contact with the host, but not with the
\quoted{mystery} hidden within (copla 3).
Taste and Smell (coplas 5 and 6) are similarly hindered by their ability only to
perceive material accidents and not spiritual substance.

The Sánchez villancico presents hearing in the last copla, through the conceit
of music.
The senses are \quoted{five instruments} like a musical consort, which must be
\quoted{tempered} by faith.
Without Faith, sight is actually blind, and touch, taste, and smell are fooled;
but when properly attuned by Faith, the senses can be harmonized into a pleasing
concord.
Here Faith is not the object of sensation, but the subject, who delights in
hearing the music of properly tuned senses.

While the poem speaks of Faith listening to the music of the senses, the musical
settings by Irízar and Carrión allow humans to listen in as well.
The musical discourse adds its own layer of meaning to the poetic discourse,
both by helping listeners imagine the contest of the senses (each setting in its
own way), and by turning the poem into an object of sensory perception.
The similarities between the settings of \wtitle{Si los sentidos} by Irízar and
Carrión demonstrate the persistence of concerns about the hearing's role in
faith.
Meanwhile the differences between versions reflect different styles not only of
composition but of devotional practice in public and private settings.

These villancicos on hearing and faith seem designed to teach listeners how to
hear music even as they are listening. They cultivate a practice of hearing
that is tempered by faith.
Irízar and Carrión take a verbal discourse on sensation and faith, in which
music is the paradigm of something that pleases the ear, and bring it to life
through actual music.
Galán attempts to create confusion among the senses; like Calderón's play, the
villancico asks listeners to doubt what they are hearing with their external
sense, but in a more positive spirit than Calderón, it urges listeners to turn
in faith to their inner, spiritual senses.
These pieces provoke listeners to a higher form of sensation, to a holy dismay
and wonder that would lead to true, faithful perception.

%{{{1 accommodating and training the ear
\section{Accommodating and Training the Ear}

%{{{2 doctrine of faith; catechisms
Catholics after Trent sought to both accommodate and train the ear because the
concept of faith required both hearing and doing.
In defiance of what they saw as Protestant redefinitions of faith, Catholic
theologians continued to develop the medieval theology of faith they inherited
from Aquinas, in which faith was one of three virtues or capacities, along with
hope and charity.%
    \Autocite[130--132]{Schreiner:Certainty}
Simple belief in intellectual propositions was \quoted{unformed faith}
(\term{fides informe}).%
    \Autocite[\sv{Credo in Deum Patrem, 15--20}]{Catholic:Catechismus1614}
It was essential that every Christian believe certain things, but true
Christianity required one to develop the higher state of \quoted{formed faith}
(\term{fides formata}).
This kind of faith \quoted{worked through} hope and love to result in  what
might best be translated as \quoted{faithfulness}.
True faith was a conviction that manifested itself through ethical behavior in
fidelity to God's will.
Christian disciples were required not only to \quoted{hear} the Church's
teaching and believe it (this would be unformed faith); they also had to
\quoted{listen} in the sense of obeying.

The Church emphasized this theme in its official guidance for religious
teachers, the new catechism \quoted{for parish priests} commissioned by the
Council of Trent and first published in 1566.%
    \Autocites
    {Catholic:Catechismus1614}
    [\sv{catechism}]{NewCatholic}
This Latin catechism was a model for teaching the clergy how to preach and
teach---a guide both to the content of the Faith and to the best ways of making
it heard and understood.%
    \Autocite[\sv{Trent, Council of}]{NewCatholic}
From the outset the document makes hearing central to faith, because the object
of faith is Christ, the Word of God, and the Church's mission is to make that
Word audible.
The preface teaches that God communicated his own nature to humanity by taking
on human flesh in Christ.
In the words of John's gospel, Jesus Christ himself was the \term{logos} or
\term{verbum} (\scripture{Jn 1:1}), the \quoted{Word made flesh}.
Where God had previously spoken through the law and the prophets, now he had
spoken through his Son (\scripture{Heb 1:1}).
Therefore the true Word of God was not confined to Scripture or doctrines
alone---the Word was a person, Jesus Christ, to whom the prophetic scriptures
testified and from whom the Church's doctrine flowed.%
    \Autocite[9]{Catholic:Catechismus1614}

The theology of Christ (Christology) becomes the catechism's foundation for its
theology of the church (ecclesiology).
Christ, the incarnate Word, appointed apostles, chief among them St. Peter, to
be the custodians of the true faith, so that the community of the Church became 
the sacramental means through which people would come to know Christ after his
resurrection.
There was thus a close link between hearing the Word of the Church's teaching,
obeying that Word, and encountering Christ who was the Word.
The catechism places a distinctly Catholic emphasis on obedience and faithful
living---that is, on \quoted{formed faith} that manifests in love---countering
the Protestant emphasis on salvation by faith alone.
Since \quoted{in this we know that we know him, if he keep his commandments}
(\scripture{1Jn 2:3}), teachers should model faithful living, \quoted{not in
leisure} but \quoted{in applying diligent effort to justice, piety, faith,
charity, mercy}, having been redeemed \quoted{to do good works}
(\scripture{1Tm 2:12}); so that \quoted{whether one sets out to believe or
hope or do anything}, the love of God should be the summit of all Christian
life.%
    \Autocite[6--7]{Catholic:Catechismus1614}
Listening to Christ the Word meant joining oneself to the Church, which was
Christ's body, the physical and social manifestation of the Word in the world.

If believers had to hear, believe, and obey the Word in the Church, then church
teachers needed to both make the Word audible and teach listeners how to hear
it. 
\quoted{Since, therefore, faith is conceived by means of hearing}, the
catechism teaches, 
\begin{quoting}
    it is apparent how necessary it is for achieving eternal life to follow the
    works of the legitimate teachers and ministers of the faith. 
    \Dots{} Those who are called to this ministry should understand that in
    passing along the mysteries of faith and the precepts of life, \emph{they
    must accommodate the teaching to the sense of hearing and intelligence}, so
    that by these \add{mysteries and precepts}, \emph{those who possess a
    well-trained sense} should be filled up by spiritual food.%
        \Autocite[2, 8--9 (emphasis added)]{Catholic:Catechismus1614}
\end{quoting}
To do this, pastors should consider \quoted{the age, intelligence, customs,
condition} of their charges, to give milk to spiritual infants and solid food
to the maturing, to raise up a \quoted{perfect man, after the measure of the
fullness of Christ}.%
    \Autocite[8]{Catholic:Catechismus1614}

This principle of accommodation was exemplified in vernacular expositions of
the catechism, like the Spanish versions by Antonio de Azevedo, Juan Eusebio de
Nieremberg, and Juan de Palafox y Mendoza.%
    \Autocites
    {Azevedo:Catecismo}
    {Nieremberg:PracticaCatecismo}
    {Palafox:Bocados}
These books brought the Church's teaching down to a more colloquial level,
aiming to help \quoted{laborers and simple folk} (in Palafox's words) with
earthy illustrations and paraphrases of Biblical stories.
These texts come alive when read aloud, and indeed the primary goal of this
literature was to prepare pastors to teach unlettered disciples through words
and voice.
The Augustinian friar Antonio de Azevedo begins his 1589 \wtitle{Catechism of
the Mysteries of the Faith} by declaring that communicating the faith requires
both trustworthy teachers and faithful listeners---a concept for which Azevedo
uses music as a key metaphor.
He begins with the image taken from Pliny of a pupil listening at the feet of a
teacher who is holding a harp.
The teacher is shown, Azevedo says,
\begin{quoting}
    with a musical instrument which gives pleasure to the ear, so that we should
    understand that Faith enters through the ear \addorig{oído}, as Saint Paul
    says, and that the disciple should be like a child, simple, without malice
    or duplicity, without knowing even how to respond or argue, but only how to
    listen and learn.
    Thus this image depicts for us elegantly, what the hearer of the Faith
    should be like.%
        \Autocite[\range{f}{1b}]{Azevedo:Catecismo}
\end{quoting}
The teacher's task, then, is not only to make the faith heard, but to make it
\quoted{appeal to the ear}, just as Azevedo says music does.

For Azevedo, proper teaching required a certain discipline from both the speaker
and the hearer.
With the threat of heresy all around, Catholic teachers did not want
parishioners believing everything they heard.
The hearer's role in this scenario is simply to listen: Azevedo does not make
any provision for the listener as a creative participant, as a reader whose
response might effect the teaching process.
Azevedo would have approved of a villancico by Joan Cererols which repeatedly
exhorts hearers to \foreign{Callar y creer}---literally, shut up and believe.%
\begin{Footnote}
    \worktitle{Serrana, tú que en los valles}, in
    \autocite[205--212]{Cererols:MEM-VC}.
\end{Footnote}

If teaching should appeal to the ear \emph{like} music, as Azevedo says, then
combining teaching with actual music would appeal all the more.
Villancicos, as an auditory medium based on poetry in the vernacular, would seem
like an ideal tool for accommodating the faith to Spanish-speaking listeners'
\quoted{sense and intelligence}, because of the medium's special appeal to the
sense of hearing, and because of its social dimensions.
At the same time, music added its own set of challenges to the task of making
faith appeal to the ear, since listeners must learn to understand not only
spoken language but musical structures as well, like Irízar and Carrión's
different ways of conveying an idea of disagreement through texture,
counterpoint, and style.
Music would seem to be a way of better accommodating faith to the sense of
hearing, but it also required more training to be heard in a faithful way.

%{{{2 experiencing truth through music: kircher
\subsection{Experiencing Spiritual Truth through Music}

This tension between accommodating and training the ear may be seen in
Athanasius Kircher's attempts to explain the spiritual power of music.
Weighing in on the Renaissance controversy of ancients versus moderns, Kircher
defends the superiority of modern music on the basis of its increased ability
to move listeners through varieties of musical structure and style.%
    \Autocite[\range{bk}{7}, \pagenum{549}]{Kircher:Musurgia}
For Kircher, music added such power to words, that it could move a listener not
only to understand the subject of the words, but to physically experience their
truth.
According to legend the famed \term{aulos} player Timotheus aroused Alexander
the Great to the furor of war through music, and Kircher says he did this by
adapting his song both to the feeling of war and to the disposition of the
king.%
    \Autocites
    [Cf.][90]{Galilei:Dialogo}
    {Dryden:Alexander}
The same music, he says, would have had a different effect on someone else:
\begin{quoting}
    If, on the other hand, \add{the musician} addressed the sort of man who was
    devoted to God and dedicated to meditation on heavenly things, and wished to
    move him in otherworldly affects and rapture of the mind, he would take up
    some notable theme expressed in words---a theme that would recall to the
    listener's memory the sweetness and mildness of heavenly things---and he
    would fittingly adapt it in the Dorian mode through cadences and intervals,
    then \add{the listener} would experience that what was said was actually
    true, those heavenly things that were made by harmonic sweetness, and he
    would suddenly be carried away beyond himself to that place where those
    joyful things are true.%
        \Autocite[\range{bk}{7}, \pagenum{550}]{Kircher:Musurgia}
\end{quoting}
Kircher says that the experience of Jesuit missionaries around the world
provides ample evidence of this miraculous power of music combined with
preaching.
But Kircher's depiction of music's power in this passage goes well beyond the
Jesuit formula of \quoted{teaching, pleasing, and persuading}.%
    \Autocite[35--51]{Bailey:Art}
Music not only makes the teaching of doctrinal truth appealing and persuasive;
it actually transforms listeners through affective experience.

In this conception, music links the objective truth with subjective experience
through the unique ways that music affects the human body.  
Kircher posits that music moves a listener's soul through the principle of
sympathy.%
    \Autocites
    {Gouk:Sciences}
    {Gouk:Harmonics}
Just as a string plucked on one lute would cause a string tuned to the same
pitch on another lute to vibrate, music created physical harmony---sympathetic
vibration---between the affective content of the music and the humors of the
person listening.
When the music moved in the same way as the affections it expressed, this in
turn moved the listener to feel the same affections:
\begin{quoting}
    Since harmony is nothing other than the concord, agreement, and mutually
    corresponding proportion between dissimilar voices, this proportion, then,
    of numbers, sets the air in motion; the motion, indeed, is to be varied by
    the ratios of various intervals, ascending and descending; so that the
    spirits \add{i.e., \term{spiritus animales}}, or the implanted internal air
    \add{in the inner ear} \Dots{}, should be moved according to the proportions
    of the motion of the external air, so that the spirits' motion are effected
    in various ways; and through this affections can be engendered in the
    person.%
        \Autocite[552]{Kircher:Musurgia}
\end{quoting}
Kircher seems to assume that the affective properties of different modes and
styles of music are inherent in the numerical proportions of the music. 
But because music's power depended on sympathetic resonance, the \emph{effect}
of music was dependent on the relationship between that objective affective
content and the subjective disposition of an individual listener.
The structure of the music's movements must correspond to the movements of the
body's humors.
Kircher theorizes that four conditions are necessary for music to achieve an
effect; without any one, music will fail to move the listener in the intended
way:
\begin{quoting}
    The first is harmony itself. Second, number, and proportion. Third, the
    power and efficacy of the words to be pronounced in music itself; or, the
    oration.
    Fourth is the disposition of the hearers, or the subject's capacity to
    remember things.%
        \Autocite[550]{Kircher:Musurgia}
\end{quoting}

Since there must be this kind of congruence between music and listener, Kircher
acknowledges that music affects different people in different ways.
First, Kircher concedes that geographic and cultural factors influence music
style and its effect, such that Italians and Germans are moved by different
styles and therefore compose differently.
These styles, he says, are the result of a national \quoted{genius} (that is,
the special gift of that people), as well as environmental factors, such that
Germans developed a grave style from living in a cold climate, contrasted with
the more moderate style of Italians.
People of the Orient who visit Rome, Kircher says, do not enjoy the highly
delicate music of that city, and prefer their own music, which he characterizes
as strident and clangorous.
These differences of style and perception are caused by the inordinate love of
things from one's own country, as Kircher describes it; and by what each person
is accustomed to hearing, which is shaped by the traditions of each country.%
    \Autocites[543--544]{Kircher:Musurgia}

Moreover, \quoted{just as different nations enjoy a different style of music,
likewise within each nation, people of different temperaments appreciate
different styles that conform the most to their natural inclinations}.%
    \Autocite[544]{Kircher:Musurgia}
What delights a person with a sanguine temperament might enrage or madden a
melancholic listener; what has a strong effect on one person may have no effect
at all on another.
\quoted{Music does not just move any subject, but the one with which the natural
humor of the music is congruent \Dots{} for unless the spirits of the receiving
subject correspond exactly, the music accomplishes nothing}.%
    \Autocite[550]{Kircher:Musurgia}
Furthermore, Kircher suggests that not only humoral temperament but also
training and intelligence are a factor in individual listening, since he
includes the capacity of memory in his list of four conditions for effective
music.

Despite Kircher's confidence in modern musicians' ability to make music move
people, his conditions were not easy to fulfill.
There had to be congruence between the structure of the music and subject of
that music, so that harmonic ratios, metrical proportions, and verbal rhetoric
all aligned.
But even this was still not enough without the fourth condition, the
disposition of the hearer, whose humoral temperament had do be succeptible to
being moved in the desired way.

This means that the tension between accommodating hearing and training it is
multiplied vastly by the addition of music.
While it might seem that music would allow for greater accommodation, the number
of potential obstacles is increased because the content of the music, the
performance, and the listeners must all be in harmony.
When Kircher compares music to preaching, he says that an effective preacher is
familiar with his audience and therefore \quoted{knows which strings to
pluck}---a phrase that recalls Antonio de Azevedo's image of the religious
teacher with harp in hand.%
    \Autocite[551]{Kircher:Musurgia}
But Kircher never fully resolves the tension between the universal power of
music and the variables of individual subjectivity and cultural conditioning.
Music could, as Kircher describes, move someone to experience the truth of
religious teaching through affective experience, but only if the listener was
\quoted{the sort of man who was devoted to God}---that is, someone who already
had faith, whose temperament was already disposed to religious devotion of this
kind.
If, as Kircher acknowledges, people of different nations are moved by different
kinds of music, and if individual people respond differently depending on their
temperament as well as their intellectual capacity, how could the creators of
sacred music be assured of its power?
How could they know which strings to pluck?

Kircher's theory represents a highly learned, quasi-scientific attempt to
reconcile the challenges of accommodating the ear and training it.
But outside the erudite realm of theoretical speculation, this was a problem
that faced every Catholic church leader who was serious about using music to
make faith appeal to hearing.
How could the Church accommodate hearing, when individuals and communities did
not hear the same way?
The capacity to listen faithfully, and therefore music's power to make faith
appeal to hearing, would be impaired by both personal subjectivity and cultural
conditioning, and these limitations created anxiety and fear about the role of
hearing in faith.

Individual subjective experience was dangerous in the Spanish Empire.
The Inquisition targeted people who claimed authority on the basis of sensory
experience, especially women who advocated mystical prayer like Teresa of Ávila
or Francisca de los Apóstoles.%
    \Autocites

    [\range{ch}{6}]{Schreiner:Certainty}
Teresa's pupil Juan de la Cruz (\circa{1542}--1591) taught his Discalced
Carmelite community in Segovia to pursue union with God by turning away from
all sensation.
Sensory experiences were real, he taught, but they were like mother's milk
given by God with the goal of bringing contemplatives to full maturity, where
they would no longer need sensation.
He defines union with God not in sensual terms but in ethical ones, as the
total surrender and conformity of one's will to God.%

    {JuandelaCruz:Subida}
Ignatius of Loyola (\circa{1491}--1556) drew on his experience in the Spanish
military to create the Society of Jesus, which required priests to submit their
individual spirituality to the Church's authority and use the \wtitle{Spiritual
Exercises} to discern the validity of their experiences.

In such a climate, music's power over feeling might open the gateway to faith,
but this power could also block one's progress.
Juan de la Cruz shared with Ignatius a suspicion of complex music; his
warnings to the Carmelite community rebuke the Spanish church's addiction to
sensory stimulation.
In his treatise on spiritual life, \wtitle{The Ascent of Mount Carmel} (written
in the 1580s but published after 1618), the reformer complains that even though
churches would seem the ideal place for prayer, their decorations, ceremonies,
and music so engage a person's senses that it can be impossible to worship God
\quoted{in spirit and in truth} (\scripture{Jn 4:23-24}).
Juan warns that desiring \quoted{to feel some effect on oneself} in doing
elaborate ceremonies \quoted{is no less than to tempt God and provoke him
gravely; so much so, that sometimes it gives license to the devil to deceive
them, making them feel and understand things far removed from what is good for
their soul}.%
    \Autocite
    [\range{bk}{3}, \range{ch}{43}, \pagenum{420}]
    {JuandelaCruz:Subida}
The monk admonishes his readers to be wary of overly artful preaching which
only serves \quoted{to delight the ear, like some polyphonic music or the
clanging of bells}:
\quoted{It matters little to hear someone perform one kind of music that is
better than some other, if it does not move me more than the other to do works;
because, although they have spoken marvels, then they are forgotten, as they do
not infuse fire into the will}.%
    \Autocite
    [\range{bk}{3}, \range{ch}{45}, \pagenum{425}]
    {JuandelaCruz:Subida}

Later Catholics who shared Juan's ascetic bent, or his pastoral concern with
spiritual growth, saw the power of music as a danger or even an opening for
diabolical influence.
But Juan's criticism did not reach the broader church (in fact it was censored
in some places), and did little to stem the tide of Catholic arts in the
following century that appealed to sensory experience with increasing
extravagance.

\subsection{Cultural Impediments to Hearing}

While individual sensation caused anxiety, Catholic missionaries were finding
that building Christian communities overseas posed additional problems because
cultural differences impacted what people heard in music.
Jesuit missionaries found themselves in what Ines Županov has termed the
\quoted{missionary tropics}---both a geographic zone and a process of  
cultural transformation (via troping or turning).%
    \Autocite{Zupanov:MissionaryTropics}
In the early stages of mission work the Jesuits, sailing under Spanish or
Portuguese flags to outposts in Japan and later Paraguay, actively sought to
accommodate local customs and music; but everywhere that missionaries brought
Christian faith, the process of cultural translation inevitably transformed it
into something neither they nor their converts could necessarily predict.%

In Spain's American realms, the first Franciscan missionaries like Pedro da
Gante used music with words in indigenous languages and assisted natives to
develop their own accommodations to Christian ritual.%
    \Autocites
    [637]{Candelaria:Psalmodia}
    {Scolieri:DancingNewWorld}
But a half century after the Aztec Empire fell, as the Spanish crown's
nominal interest in evangelization gave way to the more strategic and lucrative
goal of building a colonial society, church leaders became more interested in
safeguarding the new civilization from the resurgence of pagan belief than in
accommodating local culture. 
When the natives sang and danced, the Spaniards were not sure what they were
hearing. 
The bishops of New Spain complained that they did not have enough linguists
with sufficient knowledge of Náhuatl to verify that these songs were not in
fact still invoking demonic powers.
As Lorenzo Candelaria has suggested, when the Council of Trent issued its
infamous decree that music should be preserved from anything \quoted{lascivious
or impure}, the bishops may have been motivated in part by such songs
in non-European languages, along with other syncretic musical and ritual
practices.%
    \Autocite[637--638]{Candelaria:Psalmodia}

The cultural aspect of acquiring a \quoted{properly trained sense}, as the Roman
Catechism puts it, is plainly stated in a dialogue published by the leaders of
the Jesuit mission in Japan in 1590, which may reveal at least a trace of
non-European perspectives on European music.%
    \Autocite{Sande:DeMissioneLegatorum}
The missionaries had taken four Japanese noble youths on a grand tour of Spain
and Italy between 1582 and 1590, during which they trained in music and heard
the finest ensembles of Catholic Europe.
Their trip included most of the major Iberian musical centers discussed in this
study: on the outgoing trip, Lisbon, Évora, Toledo, Madrid, and Alcalá; and on
the return, Barcelona, Montserrat, Zaragoza, and Daroca.
With this trip and with the subsequent publication, the leader of the Jesuit
mission to Japan, Alessandro Valignano, hoped to persuade the authorities of his
order and church that (as Derek Massarella puts it) \quoted{European Jesuits
must accommodate themselves to Japanese manners and customs}.%
    \Autocite[4]{Massarella:JapaneseTravellers}
In Colloquio XI of this Latin dialogue, Michael, one of the
\quoted{ambassadors}, tells his friend who stayed home about European music:
\begin{quoting}
    You must remember \Dots{} how much we are swayed by longstanding custom, or
    on the other side, by unfamiliarity and inexperience, and the same is true
    of singing.
    You are not yet used to European singing and harmony, so you do not yet
    appreciate how sweet and pleasant it is, whereas we, since we are now
    accustomed to listening to it, feel that there is nothing more agreeable to
    the ear.

    But if we care to avert our minds from what is customary, and to consider
    the thing in itself, we find that European singing is in fact composed with
    remarkable skill; it does not always keep to the same note for all voices,
    as ours does, but some notes are higher, some lower, some intermediate, and
    when all of these are skillfully sung together, at the same time, they
    produce a certain remarkable harmony \Dots{} all of which, \Dots{} together
    with the sounds of the musical instruments, are wonderfully pleasing to the
    ear of the listener \Dots{}.

    With our singing, since there is no diversity in the notes, but one and the
    same way of producing the voice, we don't yet have any art or discipline in
    which the rules of harmony are contained; whereas the Europeans, with their
    great variety of sounds, their skillful construction of instruments, and
    their remarkable quantity of books on music and note shapes, have hugely
    enriched this art.%
        \Autocite[155-156]{Massarella:JapaneseTravellers}
\end{quoting}
The Jesuit author, Duarte de Sande, puts this reponse in the mouth of Michael's
friend Linus:
\begin{quoting}
    I am sure all these things which you say are true; for the variety of the
    instruments and the books which you have brought back, as well as the
    singing and the modulation of harmony, testify to a remarkable artistic
    system.
    Nor do I doubt that our normal expectations in listening to singing are an
    impediment when it comes to appreciating the beauties of European harmony.%
        \Autocite[156]{Massarella:JapaneseTravellers}
\end{quoting}
These words likely understate the attitude of many non-Europeans whose ears had
not yet been trained for European music.

The tension between the limitations of hearing and its capacity to lead to
faith posed a significant challenge in such an intercultural context.
As the Church was adapting itself to native sensibilities, or being adapted by
colonial subjects in ways the Church could not fully control, how was the church
to accommodate its teaching to the \quoted{sense and intelligence} of all these
different people?
Once these processes of cultural adaptation and exchange had begun to
\quoted{turn}, what parts of Christianity constituted \quoted{the Faith} that
was supposed to come through hearing?
Did changing the musical style of worship, for example, mean changing the Faith
as well?
How could the Church avoid a \quoted{dialogue of the deaf}?

Rather than providing clear solutions to this problem, some villancicos

religious teachers faced in making faith appeal to this sense.

disability as a symbol of spiritual deafness: the first is by Juan Gutiérrez de
Padilla from Puebla Cathedral in New Spain, and the other is by Matías Ruiz for
the Royal Chapel in Madrid.

\subsection{Laughing at the Deaf (Gutiérrez de Padilla, Puebla Cathedral)}

For Christmas Matins 1651 in Puebla, Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla created a comic
dialogue between a religious teacher and a \quoted{deaf} man named Toribio,
which is labeled \term{sordo} in the performing parts 
(\cref{poem:Oyeme_Toribio-Padilla}).%
\begin{Footnote}

\end{Footnote}
This piece is part of Gutiérrez de Padilla's earliest surviving complete cycle
of Christmas villancicos, which are the first extant compositions known to have
been performed in the new Puebla Cathedral, consecrated in 1649 (see
\cref{ch:padilla-voces}).
This comic \quoted{deaf} villancico explicitly plays with the challenges of
hearing the faith and making it heard.
Playing with a conventional villancico type of a dialogue between a
\foreign{docto} and a \foreign{simple}---a learned man and a
simpleton---Gutiérrez de Padilla's villancico stages a parody of the
question--answer practice of catechetical instruction.
The friar's attempts to communicate with the \quoted{deaf} man fail, and this
prompts the chorus to warn the congregation against spiritual deafness.

{\wtitle{Óyeme, Toribio (El sordo)}, from setting by Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla,
Puebla, 1651 (\sig{MEX-Pc}{Leg. 1/2}), excerpt}
%}}}5

Gutiérrez de Padilla sets the anonymous poem as a dialogue between two soloists,
each accompanied by a dulcian.
This is followed by a five-voice choral section.
Though two key partbooks are missing, including the Tenor I part who played the
deaf man, the dialogue can be reconstructed because the lyrics of the deaf man's
part were written in the surviving bass part.%
\begin{Footnote}
    In the manuscripts, \foreign{dúo} means a single voice at a time with a single
    instrumental bass line, in this case specified to be played on \term{bajón}.  
    The surviving parts for this section are Altus I and Bassus II; the Tenor I
    and Bassus I partbooks are lost.
    The Altus I includes the friar's part, which was probably accompanied by the
    Bassus I on bajón (lost).  
    The deaf man was played by the Tenor I (lost), accompanied by Bassus II on
    bajón.
    Though the Tenor I solo music is missing, the lyrics for the vocal part are
    written in above the accompaniment in the Bassus II part.  
    Thus we have the music for the friar without its accompaniment, and the
    accompaniment for the deaf man and most of the lyrics, but not the deaf
    man's music.
\end{Footnote}
The lyrics are preserved in one of the few imprints of villancico poetry from
Puebla to match up with surviving music.%
\begin{Footnote}
    Thanks to Gustavo Mauleón for allowing me to view a few pages of this
    imprint, held in an anonymous private collection in Puebla.
\end{Footnote}
Gutiérrez de Padilla dramatizes the two characters' unsuccessful attempts to
communicate through disjunctions of rhythm and mode
(\cref{mux:Padilla-Sordo-intro}).
Constantly interrupting each other, the two men follow each other's train of
thought.
Rhythmically, he gives the friar relatively refined and elegant musical speech,
while the deaf man's speech is halting and clumsy, as in the offbeat figure on
\foreign{¿Eh? ¿eh? que no te oigo} (Huh? huh? I can't hear you).
Modally, they cannot agree on where to cadence.
Given the one-flat \term{cantus mollis} signature, the cadence points
articulated by the extant bass part, and the final on F, the chapelmaster
probably would have categorized this piece as mode 11 or 12.%
    \Autocites
    [873--882]{Cerone:Melopeo} 
    {Judd:RenaissanceModalTheory}
    {Barnett:TonalOrganization17C}  
Thus the friar appropriately sings an opening phrase that surely would have
cadenced on F; but the deaf man responds with a phrase that cadences on C.
At one point the friar moves to a cadence on A, but the deaf man, responding
that he can't hear out of that ear, cadences on D. 
The friar says he will try the other ear; as though trying to meet Toribio on
his level, he moves to cadence on the same note.
But no sooner has the friar moved to D, than Toribio, saying, \quoted{Out of
that ear I hear even less!} moves to a cadence on C.  
This pushes the friar over the edge.
He bursts out, \quoted{You are a sheer idiot!}---mimicking the deaf man's
halting short-long rhythms, and returning to his own final of F.

Next the Altus I singer, who has been representing the friar, addresses the
congregation like a preacher: \quoted{The laughter of the dawn will turn to
sobs}, he says---referring to the Virgin Mary---when, having given birth to the
Word Incarnate, \quoted{her eyes see deaf men}.  
Gutiérrez de Padilla sets the final phrase about deaf men with ten blackened
notes in mensural coloration.
Where Galán used musical coloration as a symbol of blindness, here Gutiérrez de
Padilla would seem to use the same symbol to point to a deficit in hearing.
When the rest of Chorus I joins in for the responsión, their repeated dotted
rhythm and offbeat entries suggest mocking sobs and laughter \foreign{sollozos}
(\cref{mux:Padilla-Sordo-responsion}).
The descending figure is passed through all the voices in imitation, leading to
a harmonic form of descent when the Tiple I adds E flat---shifting further away
from the \quoted{natural} into the \quoted{weak} realm of flats.
The heavy syncopation in each voice creates rhythmic confusion that is not
sorted out until the final cadential flourish on F, validating the friar's
initial choice of mode.

Gutiérrez de Padilla uses his characteristic mixture of sophisticated musical
technique, high-minded theology, and low caricature to exploit the deaf for the
amusement of the hearing, making them into a warning against spiritual deafness.
The \quoted{deaf men} that will make Mary weep are all people whose ears have
been stopped by sin and cannot hear the divine Word of Christ with faith.
This concept recalls the definition of \foreign{sordo} in the 1611 Spanish
dictionary of Sebastián de Covarrubias, not one who is \emph{unable} to hear,
but rather as \quoted{he who does not hear}.
Covarrubias adds, \quoted{There is no worse kind of deaf man than the one who
is unwilling to hear}.%

\subsection{Learning from the Deaf (Ruiz, Madrid Royal Chapel)}

Matías Ruiz's \wtitle{Villancico de los sordos} from 1671 Madrid invites more
sympathy for the deaf and extends its parody to the catechist as well
(\cref{poem:Pues_la_fiesta-Ruiz-1,poem:Pues_la_fiesta-Ruiz-2}).
Here the \foreign{sordo} is a hard-of-hearing man, \quoted{very learned in
humane letters}---a doddering old university professor, or perhaps a street
sage.
The piece mocks his impairment while contrasting true faith with the book
learning of this would-be humanistic scholar.
But the biggest laughs come at the expense of the friar, as the deaf man
mishears his rote teaching formulas in increasingly absurd ways.

The piece begins with soloist and chorus gleefully crying \quoted{On with the
deaf man!} rather like a bunch of high-school bullies, telling everyone to speak
up so he can hear.
When the catechist and the \term{sordo} enter, Ruiz illustrates their inability
to understand each other with contrasting styles.
The deaf man's musical speech is abrupt, uncouth, and loud, fitting with the
friar's mockery of the deaf man's unmodulated voice
(\cref{mux:Ruiz-Sordos-dialogue}).
The deaf man bursts on the scene with a scale from the top of his register to
the bottom (\pitch{F}{4} to \pitch{G}{3}).
The descent across the registers or \term{passaggi} of the voice would encourage
the singer to bawl the phrases in a coarse tone of voice, so that ironically, a
character who cannot hear is marked for the audience by the sound he makes.

Unlike in Padilla's villancico, here the deaf man has a lesson of his own to
teach.
He may not be able to hear well but he has come with love to adore the
Christ-child.
Acting as a kind of holy fool, and echoing Covarrubias's definition of deafness,
he reminds everyone within the sound of his voice that the truly deaf are
\quoted{those who neither listen nor understand the sound}.

In the parodied catechism lesson presented in the coplas, the friar quizzes his
pupil on the same key doctrines of Christmas emphasized by contemporary
theological writers both scholastic and pastoral.%
    \Autocite[179--203]{Cashner:PhD}
Tell, \foreign{sordo}, he asks, how did God fulfill his word to the
prophet-king David?  
What motivated Christ to become incarnate? 
But the deaf man mishears every statement: he mistakes \foreign{profeta}
(prophet) for \foreign{estafeta} (mailman), and hears \foreign{decoro}
(decorum) as \foreign{Moro} (Moorish).
His supposed learning in the humanities leads only to confusion.
When the friar says \quoted{el portal es nuestro alivio} (the stable is our
remedy), the deaf man thinks he is citing \foreign{Tito Libio}.
Since the catechist has just been lauding the \foreign{bailes} (dances) of
Christmas, the humanist is puzzled: he has read the Classical historian Livy, he
says, but Livy doesn't say anything about \foreign{frailes} (friars).

Hearing that the child Jesus is shivering with cold, the deaf man suggests he
drink hot chocolate.
The friar reassures him, \quoted{the Queen}---the Virgin Mary---is keeping the
child bundled, such that he glows (\foreign{arde}) with warmth.
The deaf man now seems to feel that at last he has figured out what they are
talking about, and sums up with satisfaction, \quoted{Esta es, por la mañana y
tarde, la Reina de las bebidas} (Chocolate is, morning and evening, the Queen of
beverages).

We can imagine that Ruiz's deaf man would invite the sympathies of listeners.
He is an earthy, common character, keenly aware of the midwinter Castilian
chill, as an older man would be.
The deaf man even explicitly asks not to be mocked: since he cannot hear the
nine choirs of Christmas angels, he asks them to \quoted{sing out
loudly}---\quoted{as long as they don't say anything bad about me}.
The deaf man's bumbling but endearing statements contrast strikingly with the
friar's abstract theology and clichéd poetic language.
The characters represent contrasting types of learning: the churchman who
repeats the same teaching points in every catechism class, versus an ersatz
humanist who has read Livy and perhaps Ovid but may not understand them at all.
Ruiz's hard-of-hearing humanities scholar demonstrates a central tenet of
Reformation-era Catholicism: that Classical learning alone is not enough to
understand Christianity.%
    \Autocite[206]{Erasmus:Dolan}
What the man lacks in knowledge, though, he makes up in heartfelt devotion,
doting on the baby Jesus.

On the balance, the piece still uses deafness as a negative symbol.  When the
chorus sings that \quoted{the deaf are those who neither listen nor
understand the sound}, they use the term \term{son}, which Covarrubias defines
as a kind of dance.
Indeed, this villancico features a distinctive harmonic and rhythmic pattern
with alternating ternary and sesquialtera groupings, which are most clear on the
phrase \foreign{los que no escuchan ni entienden el son}
(\cref{mux:Ruiz-Sordos-son}).
This pattern bears a close resemblance to dance forms known as \term{son}
today---most obviously, the Mexican \term{huarache} familiar from the song
\quoted{America} in Leonard Bernstein's \wtitle{West Side Story}.%
    \Autocites
    [\sv{huarache}]{Grove}
    {Wells:WestSideStory}
Just as in the contests of the senses, then, music is the paradigm of faithful
hearing; those who can't pick up the tune, spiritually speaking, are the truly
deaf.

Where did this theology of hearing leave actual people with hearing
disabilities? 
Ironically, it was just at this time in Spain that Juan Pablo Bonet was laying
the foundations of modern deaf education.%

    Juan Pablo Bonet, \wtitle{Reduction de las letras y Arte para enseñar a

\end{Footnote}
But these villancicos do not offer much hope for the deaf.
While Calderón's Judaism heard Faith without faith, the deaf men in villancicos
cannot even hear Faith to begin with.
Whether these pieces accomplished anything more than amusing hearers by
reinforcing their prejudices is a question that haunts the whole repertoire of
Spanish devotional music---and one that should give modern performers pause
before reviving some villancicos.%
    \Autocite[7]{Cashner:WLSCM32}
Like the \quoted{ethnic villancicos} discussed in \cref{ch:intro}, these pieces
appear to welcome people from the margins of society to Christ's stable, or
around his altar, and thereby raise their status; but the stereotyped
representation actually reinforces their position at the bottom of the social
hierarchy.

\section{Failures of Faithful Hearing}

These villancicos depict failures of faithful hearing as a call for disciplined
listening.
The villancicos of the deaf fit in with a characteristic tendency of Roman
Catholics after Trent to critique the poor level of theological knowledge among
the lay people and the low quality of teaching among the clergy.%
    \Autocite[56--57]{Kamen:EarlyModernSociety}
In his vernacular catechism, the Antonio de Azevedo---an Augustinian friar
himself--- describes real-life scenes of failed catechesis: 
\begin{quoting}
    Some will say that the doctrine of the gospel has already been taught
    everywhere or almost everywhere (I am speaking of our Spain), and we
    concede; but there are so many parts that so badly lack anyone who could
    teach matters of faith, that indeed it is a shame to see it happen in many
    parts of Spain, and particularly in the mountains, where there are many so
    unlettered \addorig{bozales} in the matters of faith, that if you would ask
    them, how many are the persons of the Holy Trinity, some would say that they
    are seven, and others, fifteen; and others say about twenty---of this I am a
    good witness.
    And a principal friar of my order, I've heard that once he was asking a
    woman how many \add{persons in the Trinity} there were, and she said,
    \quoted{Fifteen}. 
    And he said, \quoted{\emph{Ay}, is that really your answer?} 
    And then she wanted to correct herself, and she said, \quoted{\emph{Ay
    Señor}, I think I was wrong---I'll say there are five hundred}.%
        \Autocite[26]{Azevedo:Catecismo}
\end{quoting}
Azevedo sees no humor in this lack of religious knowledge; and he faults not the
illiterate laypeople but the friars and clergy who have failed to teach the
basics of faith in a plain way, as Azevedo himself endeavors to do in his book:
\begin{quoting}
    It is a shame to see the ignorance that there is in many, in things of such
    importance \Dots{}.
    Because even though the religious orders and those who preach do declare the
    gospel, they do not explain the ABCs \addorig{b, a, ba} of Christianity;
    they do not want to deal with giving milk because this is the task of
    mothers, those lordly Curates or Orators, who are responsible for this task,
    and what I have described is their fault.%
        \Autocite[27]{Azevedo:Catecismo}
\end{quoting}
The friars of the villancicos by Gutiérrez de Padilla and Ruiz villancicos seem
to fit with Azevedo's description of \quoted{lordly orators} who delight in
lofty language and fail to adapt their disciples' capacity, rather than motherly
teachers who spell out the fundamentals of Christian faith.
Both pieces illustrate the difference in language and understanding between
teacher and pupil through fitting contrasts of musical style.

What does it mean, then, that this music invites hearers to laugh at the
Church's incompetent teachers? 
After all, the friars are caricatured just as much as the deaf men are.
Gutiérrez de Padilla's piece was performed at the epicenter of religious reform
in the New World, and Ruiz's piece may have been heard by the royal defender of
the faith Charles II.  
The function of villancicos must be more complex than the imposition of dogma.
Few villancicos of the seventeenth century would satisfy Azevedo's call to teach
the \quoted{\emph{b, a, ba} of Christianity}.  
As the severity of the years after Trent gave way to Baroque aesthetics that
valued more elaborate forms of expression, even the comic villancicos involved
learned plays of language and music, like the Classical references in Ruiz's
poetic text, or the play on modal cadences and black notation of Gutiérrez de
Padilla's music.
Composers of villancicos in the seventeenth century seem to have followed an
ideal closer to Kircher's Jesuit ideal of affectively powerful sacred music
attuned to the varying desires of a broad audience.
The depictions of imperfect hearing in the villancicos of the deaf, in fact,
depended on the attention of listeners with well-trained ears.

%{{{2 make a hedge
\subsection{\quoted{Make a Hedge around Your Ears}}

To understand the role of villancicos in the dynamics of hearing and faith,
then, we must consider these performative texts as more than just one-way
transmissions of religious teaching from the Church to listening worshippers.
The creators of these pieces seem to expect listeners to be active, attentive,
and intelligent.
Indeed, Catholic listeners in this period had to pay attention, because as
multiple examples have demonstrated, hearing was \quoted{the sense most easily
deceived} and the faithful were not expected to believe everything they heard.
Hearing with faith meant questioning anything that contradicted true faith and
accepting the true faith even when it defied the senses.

It is clear from a rare listener's account of a villancico performance that not
everyone felt adequately trained to appreciate this music.
The chronicler of a Zaragoza festival in 1724 praises the performance by the
musicians of the city's two principal churches, El Pilar and La Seo, leaning
heavily on a stock vocabulary for musical encomium: 
\begin{quoting}
    During the whole event, the senses were enchanted with an imponderable
    spell by the sweet, solemn, and sonorous harmony, with which the two
    chapels, united to this end by the chapter, officiated the Mass, and since
    in the short time that was given to their Masters for composition, it was
    necessary that they employed, in competition, the most exquisite skill of
    the art, which should be credited mutually to the virtuosity of the voices
    and the well-adjusted management of the instruments.  
    Each Master set to music one of the following villancicos, which were part
    of the design of the chapter's order.
\end{quoting}
The writer concludes, \quoted{The two villancicos were sung nobly, and were
heard with pleasure}, but, truth be told, \quoted{it would have been
even better, if every ear was intelligent in points of consonance}.%
\begin{Footnote}

    The language used to describe music reiterates a set of key vocabulary that
    appears in most of the texts of villancicos about music in this
    study---\foreign{dulce, grave, y sonora armonía}, \foreign{primor},
    \foreign{destreza}, \foreign{puntos de consonancia}.

In the anxious theological climate of early modern Spain, though, not even an
aural-skills course would meet the more pressing demand for spiritual discipline

Sebastián de Covarrubias, the dictionary author, also published a book of
\wtitle{Moral Emblems}, which includes an image of two fragile human ears,
protected from the four winds by a crown of thorns
(\cref{fig:Covarrubias-Emblemas-202-ears-thorns}).%

Its Latin motto, from Sirach 28:28, reads, \quoted{Make a hedge around your
ears with thorns}.
In the poem and prose explanations, readers were advised to shield their ears
\quoted{from hearing flattery, gossip, lies, and false doctrines; and so that
these things will not reach our ears we must put a strong fence around them,
and protect it with thorns}.%
    \Autocite[203]{Covarrubias:Emblemas}
\quoted{In this life, which is a battle}, Covarrubias warns, \quoted{if you
wish to keep yourself safe, take refuge in Christ and his crown}.%

Spanish devotional music of the seventeenth century appealed to the ears of
diverse people at different levels; but it challenged all of them to
\quoted{temper} their own hearing, as the Segovia villancicos say, lest the
Church's musical proclamation of faith fall on \quoted{deaf ears}.
The fundamental Tridentine problem, of making faith appeal to hearing by both
accommodating the senses and training them, remained a challenge for Catholics,
both those who would teach through speech or song and those who would listen.
