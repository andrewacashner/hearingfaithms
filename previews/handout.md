## Accommodating and Training the Ear; Hearing Christ the Word

> Faith comes through hearing,\
> and hearing, by the word of Christ.\
> --- Romans 10:17

> Since faith is conceived by means of hearing, it is apparent, how
> necessary it is for achieving eternal life to follow the works of the
> legitimate teachers and ministers of the faith. Those who are called to
> this ministry should understand that in passing along the mysteries of faith
> and the precepts of life, *they must accommodate the teaching to the sense of
> hearing and intelligence*, so that by these mysteries and precepts, *those
> who possess a well-trained sense* should be filled up by spiritual food.
[@Catholic:Catechismus1614, 2, 8--9 (emphasis added)]

### Experiencing Spiritual Truth through Music

> If a musician addressed the sort of man who was
> devoted to God and dedicated to meditation on heavenly things, and wished to
> move him in otherworldly affects and rapture of the mind, he would take up
> some notable theme expressed in words---a theme that would recall to the
> listener's memory the sweetness and mildness of heavenly things---and he would
> fittingly adapt it in the Dorian mode through cadences and intervals, then
> the listener would experience that what was said was actually true, those
> heavenly things that were made by harmonic sweetness, and he would suddenly be
> carried away beyond himself to that place where those joyful things are
> true. 
[@Kircher:Musurgia, bk. 7, p. 550]

### Danger and Doubt

> How commonly we see that if the preacher's life is better, greater is
> the fruit that he gains, though his style be low and his rhetoric scanty, and
> his teaching common, because the living spirit infuses him with ardor; but the
> other preacher gets very little gain, no matter how much more elevated his
> style and doctrine may be: because, though it is true that good style and
> actions and elevated doctrine and good language move and create more effect
> when accompanied by a good spirit, without the spirit, though the sermon may
> give the sense and understanding much to savor and enjoy, it infuses little or
> no sustenance to the spirit, because commonly it remains as lax and loath as
> before to labor, even though marvelous things were said in marvelous ways,
> which only serve to delight the ear, like some polyphonic music 
> or the clanging of bells. It matters little to hear
> someone perform one kind of music that is better than some other, if it does
> not move me more than the other to do works; because, although they have
> spoken marvels, then they are forgotten, as they do not infuse fire into the
> will.
[@JuandelaCruz:Subida, bk. 3, ch. 45, p. 425]

### Cultural Conditioning in Hearing

> MICHAEL: You must remember how much we are swayed by longstanding
> custom, or on the other side, by unfamiliarity and inexperience, and the same
> is true of singing. You are not yet used to European singing and harmony, so
> you do not yet appreciate how sweet and pleasant it is, whereas we, since we
> are now accustomed to listening to it, feel that there is nothing more
> agreeable to the ear. 

> But if we care to avert our minds from what is customary, and to consider the
> thing in itself, we find that European singing is in fact composed with
> remarkable skill; it does not always keep to the same note for all voices, as
> ours does, but some notes are higher, some lower, some intermediate, and when
> all of these are skillfully sung together, at the same time, they produce a
> certain remarkable harmony all of which, together with the
> sounds of the musical instruments, are wonderfully pleasing to the ear of the
> listener. 

> With our singing, since there is no diversity in the notes, but one and the
> same way of producing the voice, we don't yet have any art or discipline in
> which the rules of harmony are contained; whereas the Europeans, with their
> great variety of sounds, their skillful construction of instruments, and their
> remarkable quantity of books on music and note shapes, have hugely enriched
> this art. 

> LINUS: I am sure all these things which you say are true; for the variety of the
> instruments and the books which you have brought back, as well as the singing
> and the modulation of harmony, testify to a remarkable artistic system. Nor
> do I doubt that our normal expectations in listening to singing are an
> impediment when it comes to appreciating the beauties of European harmony.

## Failures of Faithful Hearing

> Some will say that the doctrine of the gospel has already been taught
> everywhere or almost everywhere (I am speaking of our Spain), and we concede;
> but there are so many parts that so badly lack anyone who could teach matters
> of faith, that indeed it is a shame to see it happen in many parts of Spain,
> and particularly in the mountains, where there are many so unlettered
> in the matters of faith, that if you would ask them, how many are
> the persons of the Holy Trinity, some would say that they are seven, and
> others, fifteen; and others say about twenty---of this I am a good witness. 

> And a principal friar of my order, I've heard that once he was asking a woman
> how many [persons in the Trinity] there were, and she said, "Fifteen." And he
> said, "*Ay*, is that really your answer?"
> And then she wanted to correct herself, and she said, "*Ay Señor*, I think I
> was wrong---I'll say there are five hundred." 

> It is a shame to see the ignorance that there is in many, in things of such
> importance. 
> Because even though the religious orders and those who preach do declare the
> gospel, they do not explain the ABCs [*b, a, ba*] of Christianity; they do not
> want to deal with giving milk because this is the task of mothers, those
> lordly Curates or Orators, who are responsible for this task, and what I have
> described is their fault. 
[@Azevedo:Catecismo, 26--27]


<!--
> During the whole event, the senses were enchanted with an imponderable spell
> by the sweet, solemn, and sonorous harmony, with which the two chapels, united
> to this end by the chapter, officiated the Mass, and since in the short time
> that was given to their Masters for composition, it was necessary that they
> employed, in competition, the most exquisite skill [*primor*] of the art,
> which should be credited mutually to the virtuosity [*destreza*] of the voices
> and the well-adjusted management of the instruments.  Each Master set to music
> one of the following villancicos [included in the chronicle], which were part
> of the design of the chapter's order.
> The two villancicos were sung nobly, and were heard with pleasure, but it
> would have been even better if every ear was intelligent in points of
> consonance."
