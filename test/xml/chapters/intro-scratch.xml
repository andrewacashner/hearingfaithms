  <head>Pieces with Multiple Topics: Padilla and Cererols</head>

<p> It is common to find references to several of these topics in
a single piece, and looking at two typical examples of this sort will
begin to make clear what is meant by metamusical villancicos.  The
first example is a villancico from the 1652 Christmas cycle (MEX-Pc:
Leg. 1/2) written for the Cathedral of Puebla de los Ángeles by Juan
Gutiérrez de Padilla (ca. 1590–1664).<!-- --><note> Many scholars use
the full surname Gutiérrez de Padilla, but it will be convenient
throughout the dissertation to refer to this composer the way the
Puebla manuscripts do, as simply <q>Padilla</q>.  <!-- TODO ref to
later chapters discussing Padilla --> </note>

In just the first seven lines of this anonymous text, the
villancico refers to sound, voices, singing, choirs, dancing, birds,
and solmization (poem <ptr type="doc"
target="#poem:En_la_gloria_de_un_portalillo"/>).  </p>

<q type="poemtranslation"
xml:id="poem:En_la_gloria_de_un_portalillo"> <head> <title>En la
gloria de un portalillo</title>, estribillo as set by Juan Gutiérrez
de Padilla, Puebla Cathedral, Christmas 1652 (MEX-Pc: Leg. 1/2)
</head> <seg type="orig" xml:lang="es"> <lg> <l>En la gloria de un
portalillo,</l> <l>los zagales se vuelven niños</l> <l>y en tonos
sonoros</l> <l>repiten a coros</l> <l>en bailes lucidos.</l> <l>Canten
las aves</l> <l>al Sol nacido.</l> <l>¡Vaya de fiestas!</l> <l>pues
Dios es niño.</l> </lg> </seg> <seg type="trans"> <lg> <l>In the glory
(<term>Gloria</term>) of a little stable,</l> <l>the shepherd boys
become children</l> <l>and in resounding tones</l> <l>they repeat in

the birds sing</l> <l>to the newbord Sun [the note
<term>sol</term>]</l> <l>for God is a baby boy.</l> </lg> </seg> </q>

<p> Padilla’s setting demonstrates several typical features of the
genre (music example <ptr type="doc"
target="#music:Padilla-En_la_gloria_de_un_portalillo"/>).  <!-- TODO
cite recording --> The piece begins with a soloist whose words present
a striking poetic conceit, and whose music likewise lays out a central
musical theme for the <term>estribillo</term> (refrain).  The solo
line is followed by a passage of polychoral dialogue between two
four-voice choirs, concluding (typically for polychoral technique)
with an emphatic cadence for the full chorus.  Padilla’s setting is in
a lively triple meter (<term>tiempo menor de proporción menor</term>,
notated CZ in Spanish sources) that makes frequent use of
<term>sesquialtera</term> or hemiola.<!--

--><note> The preface provides additional background about the
terminology and common structures of seventeenth-century villancicos.
Please note the discussion there on common voicing and instrumentation
patterns, and on rhythmic theory.  </note>

The shifts of duple and triple stresses combine with stresses on
the second beat of the <term>compás</term> (<term>tactus</term>,
measure) to create an energetic atmosphere with a rejoicing affect.
The polychoral dialogue, with the voices of each choir declaiming
homorhythmically in the same highly rhythmic, syncopated manner as the
soloist, and with the <term>tiples</term> (boy sopranos) of both
choirs singing at the top of their range, would have brilliantly
seized the attention of listeners.  </p>

</figure>

<p> After this introductory <term>exordium</term>, the Tiple I
soloist continues to describe the scene at the manger.  As the
shepherds <q>are turned to boys</q>, Padilla has the musicians
<q>turn</q> modally by adding C sharps, accented in a sesquialtera (3
: 2) group.  The passage that follows this moment is in evenly
accented ternary patterns, in two-compás groups.  These groups
emphasize the rhymes in <q xml:lang="es">tonos sonoros, repiten a
coros</q> and the clear triple meter evokes the dances of <q
xml:lang="es">en bailes lucidos</q>.  </p> <p> When the soloist refers
to the newborn Sun, he sings the note identified in Guidonian
terminology as <term>D (la, sol, re)</term>—<term>sol</term> in the
hard (G) hexachord.  On the wame word, the bass accompanist plays a
different <term>sol</term>, <term>G (sol, re, ut)</term>. (Note that
<q xml:lang="es">sol re</q> in Spanish means <q>sun king</q>.)<!--

--><note> The major Spanish music-theoretical treatises of the
seventeenth century give full expositions of the techniques of
Guidonian solmization, and the frequent use of Guido's syllables in
villancicos suggests that these treatises do reflect how music was
actually taught in practice.  See <ptr target="#Cerone1613"/> and <ptr
target="#Lorente1672"/>.  </note> </p> <p> Padilla's villancico may be
understood as <q>singing about singing</q> on several levels.  The
poetic text, which being performed through music, itself refers to
musical performance.  The performance by the Puebla Cathedral chapel
dramatizes the historical celebration of the first Christmas while
also celebrating the festival in Padilla’s present day.  The music is
self-referential on a symbolic level (as in the plays on
<term>sol</term>), but also functions on a more simple affective level
to model and incite affections of exuberant joy and wonder, which
contemporary theological writers emphasized were the appropriate
affects for the feast of Christmas.<!--

--><note> See the detailed discussion of such sources in chapter
3.  </note> </p> <p> A similar example of a villancico that includes
multiple metamusical topics is <title>Fuera, que va de
invención</title> (E-Bbc: M/760) by Joan Cererols (1618–1680), monk
and chapelmaster at the Benedictine Abbey of Montserrat near
Barcelona.<!-- --><note> <ref><ptr target="#Cererols1932"/>,
81–94.</ref> Another villancico by Cererols is the subject of chapter
4.  <!-- TODO check chapter number; cite recording --> </note> Like
the numerous catalog-style Christmas songs in English, from
<title>Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly</title> to <title>Chestnuts
Roasting on an Open Fire</title>, this villancico summons up all the
elements of a Christmas festival—masques, <q
xml:lang="es">zarabandas</q> (sarabandes) and other dancing, lavish
decorations and clothing, pipes, drums, and so on.  As in many
villancicos, the chorus acts dramatically in the role of the festival
crowd, shouting affirmations (<q xml:lang="es">¡vaya!</q>) for each
element of the celebration as the soloists name them.  Whereas
Padilla’s <title>En la gloria de un portalillo</title> focused
primarily on the music of the historical Christmas day, the villancico
of Cererols is unambiguously about celebrating <soCalled>Christmas
present</soCalled>.  The piece seeks a theological meaning behind the
Christmas customs: the masques of Christmas, the poem says, are
appropriate because in the Incarnation of Christ, <q
xml:lang="es">Dios se disfraza</q> (God masks himself).  The
villancicos allows performers and listeners to celebrate the festival
in two senses: to sing the praises of the Christmas feast, while also
singing the praises of Christ that are appropriate to that feast.
Cererols’s original audience of pilgrims to the mountaintop shrine of
Montserrat would not have sung along with this piece, but the piece
still invites their wholehearted participation in the rituals of
Christmas, both through enjoying the choral singing (and joining
<soCalled>in spirit</soCalled>, perhaps), and in the many other
common-culture customs that the piece celebrates.  </p> </div>
