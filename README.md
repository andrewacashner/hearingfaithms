# Hearing Faith: Music as Theology in the Spanish Empire

Copyright Â© 2020 Andrew A. Cashner

Assistant professor of music, College Department of Music,

## Requirements

- [LaTeX, Full TeXLive 2019 distribution](http://www.tug.org)
- [Lilypond, Version 2.19+](http://www.lilypond.org)
- [Brill font](https://brill.com/page/1228?lang=en)
- Linux utilities: BASH shell, GNU Make:
  I am using [Fedora 31](https://getfedora.org/)

Note: The indexing program `xindy` requires `libncurses.so.5`. On current
Fedora this requires installing the package `ncurses-compat-libs`.

## Installation

Clone the Git repository to a local directory:

````
git clone git@bitbucket.org:andrewacashner/vcbook.git
````

## Compilation (LaTeX -> PDF)

The Makefile compiles each music example as a separate cropped PDF using
Lilypond and stores these in `build/music-examples`.
It compiles the other kinds of floats using LaTeX and puts them in their build
subdirectories.
It copies the figures into `build/figures`.

Then it compiles the whole document using LaTeX including all chapters and
included floats and stores the result in `build`.

All necessary configuration files for LaTeX and Lilypond are included in the
`tex/` and `ly/` directories, respectively.

1. Start fresh: `make reset`
2. Compile whole document including separately compiled floats: `make`
  (`make -B -j4` to quickly recompile everything with 4 processor cores)
  - To compile the Lilypond PDFs only, `make ly`.
3. Count words: `make count`
4. View PDF: `make view`

## Components

The master file is `main.tex`, and it includes the full outline of parts and
chapters.

Table of contents, lists of floats, bibliography, and index are automatically
generated by LaTeX.

## LaTeX configuration

The main document class is `tex/vcbook.cls`. That class uses the packages
`tex/vcbook-macros.sty`, `tex/vcbook-format.sty`, and the other `*.sty` files
in the `tex` directory.

The float files use `tex/vcbook-float.cls`, which requires fewer packages
(e.g., `biblatex`). It also calls the packages listed above.
