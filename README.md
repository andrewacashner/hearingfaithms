# Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Devotional Music of the Spanish Empire

Andrew A. Cashner

## Compilation

The make script `./make.sh` produces 

- separate ODT files for each chapter specified, output to `odt/`
- single PDF file output for all chapters specified, as `pdf/all.pdf`
    ./make.sh

Cross references for floats are written as `label:type:key` and `ref:type:key`.
These are pre-processed with my Scheme program `xref`.
My program `xref-list` processes the auxiliary file generated by `xref` to make
a list of filenames in order, to include the separate files for floats.
