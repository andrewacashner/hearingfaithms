# Faith, Hearing, and the Power of Music in Devotional Music of the Spanish Empire

Andrew A. Cashner

## Compilation

1. The make script `./make.sh` produces 

- separate ODT files for each chapter specified, output to `odt/`
- single PDF file output for all chapters specified, as `pdf/all.pdf`
    ./make.sh

Cross references for floats are written as `label:type:key` and `ref:type:key`.
These are pre-processed with my Scheme program `xref`.
My program `xref-list` processes the auxiliary file generated by `xref` to make
a list of filenames in order, to include the separate files for floats.

2. The script `./make-floats.sh` produces PDF files for each of the float files
   in `tables`, `poetry-examples`, and `music-examples`. For tables and poems,
   it compiles them with LaTeX; for music-examples, with Lilypond. For tables
   and music examples, it crops them.
